Django Admin Configuration.

I use this file to register our models with the Django Admin interface. 
This gives us a ready-made user interface to view and manage our database.

I've registered 'KnowledgeDocument' here so you can verify uploaded files, 
and 'InteractionLog' so you can read through the Q&A history directly in your browser.
