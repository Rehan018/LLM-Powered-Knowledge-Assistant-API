"""
Unit Tests for the Assistant App.

This is where I write automated tests to make sure everything is working as expected.

I use this to verify things like:
1. Are the models creating records correctly?
2. Is the Ingestion Service correctly splitting the text?
3. Does the API return a 200 OK when we send a valid question?

It's good practice to keep tests here so we can run 'python manage.py test' and catch bugs early.
