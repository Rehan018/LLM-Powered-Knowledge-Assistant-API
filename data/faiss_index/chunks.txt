 Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2005, recommends that children’s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between dif ferent subject ar eas. W e hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child- centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986). The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions.

 reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. W e must r ecognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the infor mation passed on to them by adults. T reating the pr escribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge. These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom
. The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and Reprint 2025-26  [Source: iesc1ps.pdf - Page 3] space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.

In Chapter 3, we have lear nt that atoms and molecules ar e the fundamental building blocks of matter . The existence of dif ferent kinds of matter is due to dif ferent atoms constituting them. Now the questions arise: (i) What makes the atom of one element differ ent fr om the atom of another element? and (ii) Ar e atoms r eally indivisible, as proposed by Dalton, or ar e ther e smaller constituents inside the atom? W e shall find out the answers to these questions in this chapter . We will lear n about sub-atomic particles and the various models that have been pr oposed to explain how these particles are arranged within the atom. A major challenge before the scientists at the end of the 19th century was to r eveal the structur e of the atom as well as to explain its important pr operties.

One of the first indications that atoms ar e not indivisible, comes fr om studying static electricity and the condition under which electricity is conducted by dif ferent substances. 4.1Charged Particles in Matter For understanding the natur e of char ged particles in matter , let us carry out the following activities: Activity ______________ 4.1 A.Comb dry hair . Does the comb then attract small pieces of paper? B.Rub a glass r od with a silk cloth and bring the r od near an inflated balloon. Observe what happens.From these activities, can we conclude that on rubbing two objects together , they become electrically char ged? Wher e does this charge come fr om? This question can be answer ed by knowing that an atom is divisible and consists of char ged particles. Many scientists contributed in r evealing the pr esence of charged particles in an atom.

 atom is divisible and consists of char ged particles. Many scientists contributed in r evealing the pr esence of charged particles in an atom. It was known by 1900 that the atom was indivisible particle but contained at least one sub-atomic particle – the electron identified by J.J. Thomson. Even before the electron was identified, E. Goldstein in 1886 discovered the presence of new radiations  in a gas discharge and called them canal rays. These rays were positively charged radiations which ultimately led to the discovery of another sub-atomic particle. This sub-atomic particle had a charge, equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to that of the electron. Its mass was approximately 2000 times as that of the electron. It was given the name of proton. In general, an electron is represented as ‘e–’ and a proton as ‘p+’. The mass of a proton  is taken as one unit and its charge as plus one. The mass of an electron is considered to be negligible and its charge is minus one. It seemed that
 as ‘e–’ and a proton as ‘p+’. The mass of a proton  is taken as one unit and its charge as plus one. The mass of an electron is considered to be negligible and its charge is minus one. It seemed that an atom was composed of protons and electrons, mutually balancing their charges. It also appeared that the protons were in the interior of the atom, for whereas electrons could easily be removed off but not protons. Now the big question was: what sort of structure did  these particles of the atom for m? W e will find the answer to this question below.4 S SS SSTRUCTURETRUCTURETRUCTURETRUCTURETRUCTURE      OF OFOF OFOF     THE THETHE THETHE A  A A  A ATOM TOMTOM TOMTOMChapter Reprint 2025-26  [Source: iesc104.pdf - Page 1] uestions 1.What are canal rays? 2.If an atom contains one electron and one pr oton, will it carry any charge or not? 4.2The Structure of an Atom We have lear nt Dalton’s atomic theory in Chapter 3, which suggested that the atom was indivisible and indestructible.

But the discovery of two fundamental particles (electr ons and pr otons) inside the atom, led to the failur e of this aspect of Dalton’s atomic theory. It was then consider ed necessary to know how electr ons and pr otons ar e arranged within an atom. For explaining this, many scientists pr oposed various atomic models. J.J. Thomson was the first one to pr opose a model for the structure of an atom. 4.2.1 THOMSON ’S MODEL  OF AN ATOM Thomson proposed the model of an atom to be similar to that of a Christmas pudding. The electrons, in a spher e of positive charge, were like currants (dry fruits) in a spherical Christmas pudding. W e can also think of a water melon, the positive char ge in the atom is spr ead all over like the r ed edible part of the water melon, while the electr ons ar e studded in
pherical Christmas pudding. W e can also think of a water melon, the positive char ge in the atom is spr ead all over like the r ed edible part of the water melon, while the electr ons ar e studded in the positively char ged spher e, like the seeds in the water melon (Fig. 4.1).Thomson pr oposed that: (i)An atom consists of a positively charged spher e and the electr ons ar e embedded in it. (ii)The negative and positive char ges ar e equal in magnitude. So, the atom as a whole is electrically neutral. Although Thomson’s model explained that atoms ar e electrically neutral, the results of experiments carried out by other scientists could not be explained by this model, as we will see below. 4.2.2 RUTHERFORD ’S MODEL  OF AN ATOM Ernest Ruther ford was inter ested in knowing how the electr ons ar e arranged within an atom. Ruther ford designed an experiment for this. In this experiment, fast moving alpha (α)-particles wer e made to fall on a thin gold foil. •He selected a gold foil becau

In this experiment, fast moving alpha (α)-particles wer e made to fall on a thin gold foil. •He selected a gold foil because he wanted as thin a layer as possible. This gold foil was about 1000 atoms thick. •α-particles ar e doubly-char ged helium ions. Since they have a mass of 4 u, the fast-moving α-particles have a considerable amount of ener gy. •It was expected that α-particles would be deflected by the sub-atomic particles in the gold atoms. Since the α-particles wer e much heavier than the pr otons, he did not expect to see lar ge deflections.Q Fig.4.1:  Thomson’s model of an atomJ.J. Thomson (1856– 1940),  a British physicist, was born in Cheetham Hill, a suburb of Manchester , on 18 December 1856.

STRUCTURE  OF THE ATOM 39 Reprint 2025-26  [Source: iesc104.pdf - Page 2] SCIENCE 40Fig. 4.2: Scattering of α-particles by a gold foil But, the α -particle scatterin g experiment gave totally unexpected r esults (Fig. 4.2).  The following observations wer e made: (i)Most of the fast moving α-particles passed straight thr ough the gold foil. (ii)Some of the α-particles were deflected by the foil by small angles. (iii) Surprisingly one out of every 12000 particles appear ed to rebound. In the wor ds of Ruther ford, “This r esult was almost as incr edible as if you fir e a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it comes back and hits you ”.He will hear a sound when each stone strikes the wall. If he repeats this ten times, he will hear the sound ten times. But if a bl
nch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it comes back and hits you ”.He will hear a sound when each stone strikes the wall. If he repeats this ten times, he will hear the sound ten times. But if a blind-folded child were to throw stones at a barbed-wire fence, most of the stones would not hit the fencing and no sound would be heard. This is because there are lots of gaps in the fence which allow the stone to pass through them. Following a similar reasoning, Rutherford concluded fr om the α-particle scattering experiment that— (i)Most of the space inside the atom is empty because most of the α -particles passed thr ough the gold foil without getting deflected.

From the data he also calculated that the radius of the nucleus is about 105 times less than the radius of the atom. On the basis of his experiment, Ruther ford put forwar d the nuclear model of an atom, which had the following featur es: (i)There is a positively char ged centr e in an atom called the nucleus. Nearly all the mass of an atom r esides in the nucleus. (ii)The electr ons r evolve ar ound the nucleus in circular paths. (iii) The size of the nucleus is very small as compar ed to the size of the atom.

 orbit is not expected to be stable. Any particle in a circular orbit would undergo acceleration. During acceleration, charged particles would radiate energy. Thus, the revolving electron would lose energy and finally fall into the nucleus. If this were so, the atom should be highly unstable and hence matter would not exist in the for m that we know. W e know that atoms are quite stable.E. Rutherford (1871–1937) was bor n at Spring Gr ove on 30 August 1871. He was known as the ‘Father’ of nuclear physics.  He is famous for his work on radioactivity and the discovery of the nucleus of an atom with the gold foil experiment. He got the Nobel prize in chemistry in 1908.

Neutr ons ar e present in the nucleus of all atoms, except hydr ogen. In general, a neutr on is represented as ‘n’.

The combining capacity of the atoms of elements, that is, their tendency to react and form molecules with atoms of the same or different elements, was thus explained as an attempt to attain a fully-filled outermost shell. An outermost-shell, which had eight electrons was said to possess an octet. Atoms would thus react, so as to achieve an octet in the outermost shell.

The number of electrons gained, lost or shared so as to make the octet of electrons in the outermost shell, gives us directly the combining capacity of theelement, that is, the valency discussed in the previous chapter . For example, hydr ogen/ lithium/sodium atoms contain one electron each in their outermost shell, therefore each one of them can lose one electron. So, they are said to have valency of one. Can you tell, what is valency of magnesium and aluminium? It is two and three, respectively, because magnesium has two electrons in its outermost shell and aluminium has thr ee electr ons in its outer most shell.

Hence, its valency is determined by subtracting seven electrons from the octet and this gives you a valency of one for fluorine. Valency can be calculated in a similar manner for oxygen.

All atoms of an element have the same atomic number , Z. In fact, elements ar e defined by the number of protons they possess. For hydrogen, Z = 1, because in hydr ogen atom, only one proton is pr esent in the nucleus. Similarly, for carbon, Z = 6. Ther efore, the atomic number is defined as the total number of pr otons present in the nucleus of an atom. 4.5.2 MASS  NUMBER After studying the pr operties of the sub- atomic particles of an atom, we can conclude that mass of an atom is practically due to protons and neutr ons alone. These ar e present in the nucleus of an atom. Hence protons and neutr ons ar e also called nucleons. Ther efore, the mass of an atom resides in its nucleus. For example, mass of carbon is 12 u because it has 6 pr otons and6 neutrons, 6 u + 6 u = 12 u. Similarly, the mass of aluminium is 27 u (13 protons
r efore, the mass of an atom resides in its nucleus. For example, mass of carbon is 12 u because it has 6 pr otons and6 neutrons, 6 u + 6 u = 12 u. Similarly, the mass of aluminium is 27 u (13 protons+14 neutrons). The mass number is defined as the sum of the total number of protons and neutrons present in the nucleus of an atom. It is denoted by ‘A’. In the notation for an atom, the atomic number , mass number and symbol of the element are to be written as: Mass Number QSymbol of element Atomic Number For example, nitrogen is written as 14 7N. uestions 1.If number of electrons in an atom is 8 and number of pr otons is also 8, then (i) what is the atomic number of the atom? and (ii) what is the char ge on the atom? 2.With the help of T able 4.1, find out the mass number of oxygen and sulphur atom. 4.6Isotopes In natur e, a number of atoms of some elements have been identified, which have the same atomic number but dif ferent mass numbers.

For example, take the case of hydrogen atom, it has thr ee atomic species, namely pr otium (1 1H), deuterium (2 1H or D) and tritium (3 1H or T). The atomic number of each one is 1, but the mass number is 1, 2 and 3, r espectively. Other such examples ar e (i) carbon, 12 6C and 14 6C, (ii) chlorine,  35 17Cl and  37 17Cl, etc. On the basis of these examples, isotopes are defined as the atoms of the same element, having the same atomic number but dif ferent mass numbers.

The chemical pr operties of isotopes ar e similar but their physical properties ar e different. Chlorine occurs in natur e in two isotopic forms, with masses 35 u and 37 u in the ratio of 3:1.

If an element has no isotopes, then the mass of its atom would be the same as the sum of protons and neutrons in it.

But if an element occurs in isotopic forms, then we have to know the percentage of each isotopic form and then the average mass is calculated. This does not mean that any one atom of chlorine has a fractional mass of 35.5 u. It means that if you take a certain amount of chlorine, it will contain both isotopes of chlorine and the average mass is 35.5 u.Applications Since the chemical properties of all the isotopes of an element ar e the same, normally we ar e not concer ned about taking a mixture. But some isotopes have special properties which find them useful in various fields. Some of them are : (i)An isotope of uranium is used as a fuel in nuclear reactors. (ii)An isotope of cobalt is used in the treatment of cancer . (iii) An isotope of iodine is used in the treatment of goitr e. 4.6.1 ISOBARS Let us consider two elements — calcium, atomic number 20, and ar gon, atomic number 18.

In the previous few chapters we have talked about ways of describing the motion of objects, the cause of motion and gravitation. Another concept that helps us understand and interpr et many natural phenomena is ‘work’. Closely r elated to work ar e ener gy and power . In this chapter we shall study these concepts. All living beings need food.  Living beings have to per form several basic activities to survive.  W e call such activities ‘life pr ocesses’. The ener gy for these pr ocesses comes fr om food. W e need ener gy for other activities like playing, singing, r eading, writing, thinking, jumping, cycling and running.  Activities that are strenuous r equir e more ener gy. Animals too get engaged in activities.  For example, they may jump and run.  They have to fight, move away fr om enemies, find food or find a safe place to live. Also, we engage some animals to lift weights, carry loads, pull carts or plough fields.  All such activities requir e ener gy. Think of machines. List th

List the machines that you have come across. What do they need for their working? Why do some engines r equir e fuel like petr ol and diesel?  Why do living beings and machines need energy? 10.1Work What is work? There is a dif ference in the way we use the ter m ‘work’ in day-to-day life and the way we use it in science.

Let us say the r ock does not move despite all the ef fort. Y ou get completely exhausted. However , you have not done any work on the rock as there is no displacement of the r ock. You stand still for a few minutes with a heavy load on your head.   Y ou get tired. Y ou have exerted yourself and have spent quite a bit of your energy. Ar e you doing work on the load?  The way we understand the ter m ‘work’ in science, work is not done. You climb up the steps of a stair case and reach the second floor of a building just to see the landscape fr om ther e.

cond floor of a building just to see the landscape fr om ther e.  You may even climb up a tall tr ee.  If we apply the scientific definition, these activities involve a lot of work. In day-to-day life, we consider any useful physical or mental labour as work. Activities like playing in a field, talking with friends, humming a tune, watching a movie, attending a function ar e sometimes not consider ed to be work.  What constitutes ‘work’ depends on the way we define it. W e use and define the ter m work dif ferently in science.

T o understand this, we shall first consider the case when the for ce is acting in the dir ection of displacement. Let a constant for ce, F  act on an object. Let the object be displaced through a distance, s  in the direction of the force (Fig. 10.1). Let W be the work done. W e define work to be equal to the pr oduct of the for ce and displacement. Work done =force × displacement W=F s  (10.1)in day-to-day life. For each of these activities, ask the following questions and answer them: (i)What is the work b

For each of these activities, ask the following questions and answer them: (i)What is the work being done on? (ii)What is happening to the object? (iii)Who (what) is doing the work? 10.1.2 SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTION  OF WORK To understand the way we view work and define work fr om the point of view of science, let us consider some situations: Push a pebble lying on a sur face. The pebble moves thr ough a distance. Y ou exerted a for ce on the pebble and the pebble got displaced. In this situation work is done. A girl pulls a tr olley and the tr olley moves through a distance.  The girl has exerted a force on the trolley and it is displaced. Therefor e, work is done. Lift a book thr ough a height.

A closer look at the above situations reveals that two conditions need to be satisfied for work to be done: (i) a for ce should act on an object, and (ii) the object must be displaced. If any one of the above conditions does not exist, work is not done. This is the way we view work in science. A bullock is pulling a cart.  The cart moves. Ther e is a force on the cart and the cart has moved. Do you think that work is done in this situation?

Example  10.1 A force of 5 N is acting on an object. The object is displaced through 2 m in the direction of the force (Fig. 10.2). If the force acts on the object all through the displacement, then work done is 5 N  × 2 m  =10 N m or 10 J.Fig. 10.4 Consider a situation in which an object is moving with a uniform velocity along a particular dir ection. Now a r etarding for ce, F, is applied in the opposite direction. That is, the angle between the two directions is 180º. Let the object stop after a displacement s. In such a situation, the work done by the force, F is taken as negative and denoted by the minus sign. The work done by the force is F × (–s) or (–F × s).

gains ener gy. How does an object with ener gy do work? An object that possesses ener gy can exert a force on another object. When this happens, energy is transferred fr om the for mer to the latter . The second object may move as it receives ener gy and ther efore do some work. Thus, the first object had a capacity  to do work. This implies that any object that possesses ener gy can do work. The energy possessed by a n object  is thus measur ed in  terms of  its  capacity of doing work. The unit of ener gy is, ther efore, the same as that of work , that is, joule (J).  1 J is the energy requir ed to do 1 joule of work. Sometimes a larger unit of energy called kilo joule (kJ) is used. 1 kJ equals 1000 J. 10.2.1 FORMS  OF ENERGY Luckily the world we live in provides energy in many different forms.

The relation connecting the initial velocity ( u) and final velocity ( v) of an object moving with a uniform acceleration a, and the displacement, s is v2 – u2 = 2a s This gives 2 2v – us = 2a(10.2) From section 9.4, we know F = m a.

Reprint 2025-26  [Source: iesc110.pdf - Page 7] SCIENCE 12010.2.4 POTENTIAL  ENERGY OF  AN OBJECT AT A  HEIGHT An object increases its energy when raised through a height. This is because work is done on it against gravity while it is being raised. The energy present in such an object is the gravitational potential energy. The gravitational potential ener gy of an object at a point above the gr ound is defined as the work done in raising it fr om the gr ound to that point against gravity. It is easy to arrive at an expr ession for the gravitational potential ener gy of an object at a height. Fig. 10.7 Consider an object of mass, m. Let it be raised thr ough a height, h fr om the gr ound. A force is r equir ed to do this. The minimum force requir ed to raise the object is equal to the weight of the object, mg. The object gains energy equal to the work done on it.  Let the work done on the object against gravity be W. That is, work done, W=for
 ed to raise the object is equal to the weight of the object, mg. The object gains energy equal to the work done on it.  Let the work done on the object against gravity be W. That is, work done, W=force ×  displacement = mg × h = mgh Since work done on the object is equal to mgh, an energy equal to mgh units is gained by the object. This is the potential energy ( EP) of the object. Ep = mgh (10.6) More to knowThe potential energy of an object at a height depends on the ground level or the zero level you choose.  An object in a given position can have a certain potential energy with respect to one level and a different value of potential energy with respect to another level. It is useful to note that the work done by gravity depends on the difference in vertical heights of the initial and final positions of the object and not on the path along which the object is moved. Fig. 10.8 shows a case where a block is raised fr om position A to B by taking two dif ferent paths. Let the height AB

Let the height AB = h. In both the situations the work done on the object is mgh. Fig. 10.8 Example 10.5  Find the energy possessed by an object of mass 10 kg when it is at a height of 6 m above the gr ound. Given, g = 9.8 m s–2. Solution: Mass of the object, m = 10 kg, displacement (height), h = 6 m, and acceleration due to gravity, g = 9.8 m s–2. From Eq. (10.6), Potential ener gy = mgh =10 kg × 9.8 m s–2 × 6 m =588 J.

Activity ___________ 10.14 •Many of the human activities and the gadgets we use involve conversion of energy from one for m to another . •Make a list of such activities and gadgets. •Identify in each activity/gadget the kind of energy conversion that takes place.10.2.6 LAW OF CONSERVATION  OF ENERGY In activities 10.13 and 10.14, we learnt that the form of energy can be changed from one form to another . What happens to the total energy of a system during or after the process? Whenever energy gets transformed, the total energy remains unchanged. This is the law of conservation of energy. According to this law, energy can only be converted from one form to another; it can neither be created or destroyed. The total energy before and after the transformation remains the same. The law of conservation of energy is valid                  in all situations and for all kinds of transfor
created or destroyed. The total energy before and after the transformation remains the same. The law of conservation of energy is valid                  in all situations and for all kinds of transformations. Consider a simple example. Let an object of mass, m be made to fall freely from a     height, h. At the start, the potential energy is  mgh and kinetic energy is zero. Why is the kinetic energy zero? It is zero because its velocity is zero. The total energy of the object is thus mgh. As it falls, its potential energy will change into kinetic energy. If v is the velocity of the object at a given instant, the kinetic energy would be ½mv2. As the fall of the object continues, the potential energy would decrease while the kinetic energy would increase. When the object is about to reach the ground, h = 0 and v  will be the highest. Therefore, the kinetic energy would be the largest and potential energy the least.  However , the sum of the potential ener gy and kinetic energy of the obj
e ground, h = 0 and v  will be the highest. Therefore, the kinetic energy would be the largest and potential energy the least.  However , the sum of the potential ener gy and kinetic energy of the object would be the same at all points. That is, potential energy + kinetic energy = constant    or 1constant. 22mgh + mv = (10.7) The sum of kinetic energy and potential energy of an object is its total mechanical energy. We find that during the fr ee fall of the object, the decrease in potential energy, at any point in its path, appears as an equal amount of increase in kinetic energy. (Here the effect of air resistance on the motion of the object has been ignored.) There is thus a continual transformation of gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy.

W e talk of the power of machines like motorbikes and motor cars. The speed with which these vehicles change energy or do work is a basis for their classification.  Power measur es the speed of work done, that is, how fast or slow work is done. Power is defined as the rate of doing work or the rate of transfer of ener gy. If an agent does a work W  in time t, then power is given by: Power = work/time orWP = t(10.8) The unit of power is watt [in honour of James W att (1736 – 1819)] having the symbol W. 1 watt is the power of an agent, which does work at the rate of 1 joule per second. We can also say that power is 1 W when the rate of consumption of ener gy is    1 J s–1. 1 watt = 1 joule/second or 1 W = 1 J s–1. We expr ess lar ger rates of ener gy transfer in kilowatts (kW). 1 kilowatt =1000 watts 1 kW =10

We expr ess lar ger rates of ener gy transfer in kilowatts (kW). 1 kilowatt =1000 watts 1 kW =1000 W 1 kW =1000 J s–1. The power of an agent may vary with time. This means that the agent may be doing work at dif ferent rates at dif ferent intervals of time. Therefore the concept of average power is useful. W e obtain average power by dividing the total energy consumed by the total time taken. Example 10.7  Two girls, each of weight 400 N climb up a rope through a height of 8 m.

In the pr evious chapter , we described the motion of an object along a straight line in terms of its position, velocity and acceleration. We saw that such a motion can be unifor m or non-unifor m. W e have not yet discover ed what causes the motion. Why does the speed of an object change with time? Do all motions requir e a cause? If so, what is the natur e of this cause? In this chapter we shall make an attempt to quench all such curiosities. For many centuries, the pr oblem of motion and its causes had puzzled scientists and philosophers. A ball on the gr ound, when given a small hit, does not move for ever. Such observations suggest that r est is the “natural state” of an object. This r emained the belief until Galileo Galilei and Isaac Newton developed an entir ely dif ferent appr oach to understand motion.In our everyday life we observe that some effort is r equir ed to put a stationary object into motion or to stop a moving object.

W e ordinarily experience this as a muscular ef fort and say that we must push or hit or pull on an object to change its state of motion. The concept of for ce is based on this push, hit or pull. Let us now ponder about a ‘for ce’. What is it? In fact, no one has seen, tasted or felt a force. However , we always see or feel the ef fect of a force. It can only be explained by describing what happens when a for ce is applied to an object. Pushing, hitting and pulling of objects ar e all ways of bringing objects in motion (Fig. 8.1). They move because we make a force act on them. From your studies in earlier classes, you are also familiar with the fact that a for ce can be used to change the magnitude of velocity of an object (that is, to make the object move faster or slower) or to change its dir ection of motion.

88box with a small force, the box does not move because of friction acting in a dir ection opposite to the push [Fig. 8.4(a)]. This friction force arises between two sur faces in contact; in this case,  between the bottom of the box and floor’s r ough sur face. It balances the pushing force and therefore the box does not move. In Fig. 8.4(b), the children push the box harder but the box still does not move. This is because the friction force still balances the pushing force. If the children push the box harder still, the pushing force becomes bigger than the friction force [Fig. 8.4(c)]. There is an unbalanced force. So the box starts moving. What happens when we ride a bicycle? When we stop pedalling, the bicycle begins to slow down. This is again because of the friction for ces acting opposite to the dir ection of motion. In or der to keep the bicycle moving, we have to start pedalling again. It thus appears that an  object maintains its motion under the continuous application of an 
posite to the dir ection of motion. In or der to keep the bicycle moving, we have to start pedalling again. It thus appears that an  object maintains its motion under the continuous application of an unbalanced for ce. However , it is quite incorr ect. An object moves with a unifor m velocity when the for ces (pushing force and frictional for ce) acting on the object ar e balanced and ther e is no net exter nal for ce on it. If an unbalanced for ce is applied on the object, ther e will be a change either in its speed or in the direction of its motion. Thus, to accelerate the motion of an object, an unbalanced for ce is r equir ed. And the change in its speed (or in the dir ection of motion) would continue as long as this unbalanced force is applied. However , if this for ce is8.1Balanced and Unbalanced Forces Fig. 8.3 shows a wooden block on a horizontal table. Two strings X and Y are tied to the two opposite faces of the block as shown.

nd Unbalanced Forces Fig. 8.3 shows a wooden block on a horizontal table. Two strings X and Y are tied to the two opposite faces of the block as shown. If we apply a for ce by pulling the string X, the block begins to move to the right. Similarly, if we pull the string Y , the block moves to the left. But, if the block is pulled fr om both the sides with equal for ces, the block will not move. Such for ces are called balanced for ces and do not change the state of r est or of motion of an object. Now, let us consider a situation in which two opposite for ces of dif ferent magnitudes pull the block. In this case, the block would begin to move in the dir ection of the gr eater for ce. Thus, the two for ces ar e not balanced and the unbalanced for ce acts in the dir ection the block moves. This suggests that an unbalanced force acting on an object brings it in motion.

He observed that when a marble rolls down an inclined plane, its velocity increases [Fig. 8.5(a)]. In the next chapter , you will learn that the marble falls under the unbalanced for ce of gravity as it r olls down and attains a definite velocity by the time it reaches the bottom. Its velocity decreases when it climbs up as shown in Fig. 8.5(b). Fig. 8.5(c) shows a marble resting on an ideal frictionless plane inclined on both s
inite velocity by the time it reaches the bottom. Its velocity decreases when it climbs up as shown in Fig. 8.5(b). Fig. 8.5(c) shows a marble resting on an ideal frictionless plane inclined on both sides. Galileo ar gued that when the marble is released fr om left, it would r oll down the slope and go up on the opposite side to the same height fr om which it was r eleased. If the inclinations of the planes on both sides ar e equal then the marble will climb the same distance that it cover ed while rolling down. If the angle of inclination of the right-side plane were gradually decr eased, then the marble would travel further distances till it r eaches the original height. If the right-side plane wer e ultimately made horizontal (that is, the slope is reduced to zer o), the marble would continue to travel for ever trying to r each the same height that it was r eleased fr om. The unbalanced forces on the marble in this case are zero. It thus suggests that an unbalanced (exter nal) for c
ntinue to travel for ever trying to r each the same height that it was r eleased fr om. The unbalanced forces on the marble in this case are zero. It thus suggests that an unbalanced (exter nal) for ce is r equir ed to change the motion of the marble but no net for ce is needed to sustain the unifor m motion of the marble.  In practical situations it is dif ficult to achieve a zer o unbalanced for ce. This is because of the presence of the frictional for ce acting opposite to the dir ection of motion. Thus, in practice the marble stops after travelling some distance. The ef fect of the frictional for ce may be minimised by using a smooth marble and a smooth plane and providing a lubricant on top of the planes.Fig. 8.5: (a) the downward motion; (b) the upward motion of a marble on an inclined plane; and (c) on a double inclined plane.

These thr ee laws ar e known as Newton’s laws of motion. The first law of motion is stated as: An object r emains in a state of r est or of unifor m motion in a straight line unless compelled to change that state by an applied force. In other words, all objects resist a change in their state of motion . In a qualitative way, the tendency of undisturbed objects to stay at rest or to keep moving with the same velocity is called inertia. This is why, the first law of motion is also known as the law of inertia. Certain experiences that we come across while travelling in a motor car can be explained on the basis of the law of inertia. We tend to r emain at rest with r espect to the seat until the driver applies a braking for ce to stop the motor car. With the application of brakes, the car slows down but our body

With the application of brakes, the car slows down but our body tends to continue in the same state of motion because of its inertia. A sudden application of brakes may thus cause injury to us by impact Reprint 2025-26  [Source: iesc108.pdf - Page 3] SCIENCE 90or collision with the panels in front. Safety belts are worn to prevent such accidents. Safety belts exert a force on our body to make the forward motion slower . An opposite experience is encountered when we are standing in a bus and the bus begins to move suddenly. Now we tend to fall backwards. This is because the sudden start of the bus brings motion to the bus as well as to our feet in contact with the floor of the bus. But the rest of our body opposes this motion because of its inertia. When a motorcar makes a sharp turn at a high speed, we tend to get thrown to one side. This can again be 
ith the floor of the bus. But the rest of our body opposes this motion because of its inertia. When a motorcar makes a sharp turn at a high speed, we tend to get thrown to one side. This can again be explained on the basis of the law of inertia. W e tend to continue in our straight-line motion. When an unbalanced force is applied by the engine to change the direction of motion of the motor car, we slip to one side of the seat due to the inertia of our body. The fact that a body will remain at rest unless acted upon by an unbalanced for ce can be illustrated through the following activities: Activity ______________ 8.1 •Make a pile of similar carom coins on a table, as shown in Fig. 8.6. •Attempt  a sharp horizontal hit at the bottom of the pile using another car om coin or the striker .

Once the lowest coin is removed, the inertia of the other coins makes them ‘fall’ vertically on the table.Galileo Galilei was born on 15 February 1564 in Pisa, Italy. Galileo, right from his childhood, had interest in mathematics and natural philosophy. But his father Vincenzo Galilei wanted him to become a medical doctor . Accor dingly, Galileo enr olled himself for a medical degr ee at the University of Pisa in 1581 which he never completed because of his r eal inter est in mathematics. In 1586, he wr ote his first scientific book ‘The Little Balance [La Balancitta ]’, in which he described Archimedes’ method of finding the relative densities (or specific gravities) of substances using a balance.

Her e he continued his observations on the theory of motion and through his study of inclined planes and the pendulum, for mulated the corr ect law for unifor mly accelerated objects that the distance the object moves is pr oportional to the squar e of the time taken. Galileo was also a r emarkable craftsman. He developed a series of telescopes whose optical per formance was much better than that of other telescopes available during those days. Ar ound 1640, he designed the first pendulum clock.

h to cause a small cart to pick up a large velocity will produce a negligible change in the motion of a train. This is because, in comparison to the cart the train has a much lesser tendency to change its state of motion. Accordingly, we say that the train has more inertia than the cart. Clearly, heavier or more massive objects offer larger inertia. Quantitatively, the inertia of an object is measur ed by its mass. W e may thus relate inertia and mass as follows: Inertia is the natural tendency of an object to resist a change in its state of motion or of rest. The mass of an object is a measur e of its inertia. uestions 1.Which of the following ha s more inertia: (a) a rubber ball and a stone of the same size? (b) a bicycle and a train?

t ther e is a r esistance of fered by an object to change its state of motion. If it is at rest it tends to r emain at r est; if it is moving it tends to keep moving. This pr operty of an object is called its inertia. Do all bodies have the same inertia? W e know that it is easier to push an empty box than a box full of books. Similarly, if we kick a football it flies away. But if we kick a stone of the same size with equal for ce, it har dly moves. W e may, in fact, get an injury in our foot while doing so! Similarly, in activity 8.2, instead of aQ Reprint 2025-26  [Source: iesc108.pdf - Page 5] SCIENCE 92 92929292its velocity changes, that is, the object gets an acceleration. W e would now like to study how the acceleration of an object depends on the force applied to it and how we measure a force. Let us recount some observations from our everyday life.

re a force. Let us recount some observations from our everyday life. During the game of table tennis if the ball hits a player it does not hurt him. On the other hand, when a fast moving cricket ball hits a spectator , it may hurt him. A truck at rest does not require any attention when parked along a roadside. But a moving truck, even at speeds as low as 5 m s–1, may kill a person standing in its path. A small mass, such as a bullet may kill a person when fired from a gun. These observations suggest that the impact produced by the objects depends on their mass and velocity. Similarly, if an object is to be accelerated, we know that a greater force is required to give a greater velocity. In other words, there appears to exist some quantity of importance that combines the object’s mass and its velocity. One such property called momentum was introduced by Newton. The momentum, p of an object is defined as the product of its mass, m and velocity, v. That is, p = mv (8.1) Momentum has both
its velocity. One such property called momentum was introduced by Newton. The momentum, p of an object is defined as the product of its mass, m and velocity, v. That is, p = mv (8.1) Momentum has both direction and magnitude. Its dir ection is the same as that of velocity, v. The SI unit of momentum is kilogram-metr e per second (kg m s-1). Since the application of an unbalanced for ce brings a change in the velocity of the object, it is therefore clear that a for ce also pr oduces a change of momentum. Let us consider a situation in which a car with a dead battery is to be pushed along a straight road to give it a speed of 1 m s-1, which is sufficient to start its engine. If one or two persons give a sudden push (unbalanced force) to it, it hardly starts. But a continuous push over some time results in a gradual acceleration of the car to this speed. It means that the change of momentum of the car is not only determined by the magnitude of the force but also by the time during which t
ime results in a gradual acceleration of the car to this speed. It means that the change of momentum of the car is not only determined by the magnitude of the force but also by the time during which the force is exerted. It may then also be concluded that the force necessary to change the momentum of an object dependson the time rate at which the momentum is changed. The second law of motion states that the rate of change of momentum of an object is proportional to the applied unbalanced for ce in the direction of force. 8.4.1 MATHEMATICAL  FORMULATION OF SECOND  LAW OF MOTION Suppose an object of mass, m is moving along a straight line with an initial velocity, u. It is unifor mly accelerated to velocity, v in time, t by the application of a constant for ce, F throughout the time, t. The initial and final momentum of the object will be, p1 = mu  and p2 = mv  r espectively. The change in momentum ∝p2 – p1 ∝mv – mu ∝m × (v – u). The rate of change of momentum ∝( )× −m v u t Or, the appl
initial and final momentum of the object will be, p1 = mu  and p2 = mv  r espectively. The change in momentum ∝p2 – p1 ∝mv – mu ∝m × (v – u). The rate of change of momentum ∝( )× −m v u t Or, the applied for ce, F ∝ ( )× −m v u t ( )× −=km v u tF (8.2) =  kma  (8.3) Here a ∝ = [(v – u )/t] is the acceleration, which is the rate of change of velocity. The quantity, k  is a constant of proportionality. The SI units of mass and acceleration are kg and m s-2 respectively. The unit of force is so chosen that the value of the constant, k becomes one. For this, one unit of force is defined as the amount that produces an acceleration of 1 m s-2 in an object of 1 kg mass. That is, 1 unit of force = k × (1 kg) × (1 m s-2). Thus, the value of k becomes 1. From Eq. (8.3) F = ma (8.4) The unit of force is kg m s-2 or newton, which has the symbol N.

The second law of motion is often seen in action in our everyday life. Have you noticed that while catching a fast moving cricket ball, a fielder in the ground gradually pulls his hands backwards with the moving ball? I n doing so, the fielder increases the time during which the high velocity of the moving ball decreases to zero. Thus, the acceleration of the ball is decreased and therefore the impact of catching the fast moving ball (Fig. 8.8) is also reduced. I f the ball is stopped suddenly then its high velocity decreases to zero in a very short interval of time. Thus, the rate of change of momentum of the ball will be large. Therefore, a large force would have to be applied for holding the catch that may hurt the palm of the 
in a very short interval of time. Thus, the rate of change of momentum of the ball will be large. Therefore, a large force would have to be applied for holding the catch that may hurt the palm of the fielder . In a high jump athletic event, the athletes are made to fall either on a cushioned bed or on a sand bed. This is to increase the time of the athlete’ s fall to stop after making the jump. This decreases the rate of change of momentum and hence the force. Try to ponder how a karate player breaks a slab of ice with a single blow.The first law of motion can be mathematically stated from the mathematical expression for the second law of motion. Eq. (8.4) is F = ma or F( )−=m v u t(8.5) or Ft = mv – mu That is, when F = 0, v = u  for whatever time, t is taken. This means that the object will continue moving with uniform velocity , u throughout the time, t . If u is zero then v  will also be zero. That is, the object will remain at rest.

(8.4), we have F = ma. Here we have m1 = 2 kg; a1 = 5 m s-2 and m2 = 4 kg; a2 = 2 m s-2. Thus,  F1 =  m1a1 = 2 kg × 5 m s-2 = 10 N; and F2  =  m2a2  = 4 kg × 2 m s-2 = 8 N. ⇒ F1 > F2.

Calculate the force exerted by the brakes on the motor car if its mass along with the passengers is 1000 kg. Solution: The initi
ity of 108 km/h and it takes 4 s to stop after the brakes ar e applied. Calculate the force exerted by the brakes on the motor car if its mass along with the passengers is 1000 kg. Solution: The initial velocity of the motorcar u = 108 km/h = 108 × 1000 m/(60 ×  60 s) = 30 m s-1 and the final velocity of the motorcar v = 0 m s-1. The total mass of the motorcar along with its passengers = 1000 kg and the time taken to stop the motor car, t = 4 s. From Eq. (8.5) we have the magnitude of the for ce (F) applied by the brakes as m(v – u)/t . On substituting the values, we get F= 1000 kg × (0 – 30) m s-1/4 s = – 7500 kg m s-2 or – 7500 N. The negative sign tells us that the force exerted by the brakes is opposite to the direction of motion of the motor car. Exampl e 8.4 A force of 5 N gives a mass m1, an acceleration of 10 m s–2 and a mass m2, an acceleration of 20 m s-2. What acceleration would it give if both the masses wer e tied together?Solution: From Eq. (8.4) we have m1 = F/a1; and m2
ss m1, an acceleration of 10 m s–2 and a mass m2, an acceleration of 20 m s-2. What acceleration would it give if both the masses wer e tied together?Solution: From Eq. (8.4) we have m1 = F/a1; and m2 = F/a2. Here, a1 = 10 m s-2; a2 = 20 m s-2 and F = 5 N. Thus,  m1 = 5 N/10 m s-2 = 0.50 kg; and m2 = 5 N/20 m s-2 = 0.25 kg. If the two masses wer e tied together , the total mass, m would be m = 0.50 kg + 0.25 kg = 0.75 kg. The acceleration, a produced in the combined mass by the 5 N for ce would be, a = F/m = 5 N/0.75 kg = 6.67 m s-2.

Fig. 8.9 How much force does the table exert on the ball to bring it to rest? Solution: The initial velocity of the ball is 20 cm s-1. Due to the friction al force exerted by the table, the velocity of the ball decr eases down to zer o in 10 s. Thus , u = 20 cm s–1; v = 0 cm s-1 and t = 10 s. Since the velocity-time graph is a stra

Since the velocity-time graph is a straight line, it is clear that the ball moves with a constant accelerat ion. The acceleration a is −=v ua t = (0 cm s-1 – 20 cm s-1)/10 s = –2 cm s-2 = –0.02 m s-2.

The negative sign implies that the frictional force exerted by the table is opposite to the direction of motion of the ball. 8.5Third Law of Motion The first two laws of motion tell us how an applied for ce changes the motion and pr ovide us with a method of deter mining the for ce. The thir d law of motion states that when one object exerts a force on another object, the second object instantaneously exerts a for ce back on the first. These two forces ar e always e
g the for ce. The thir d law of motion states that when one object exerts a force on another object, the second object instantaneously exerts a for ce back on the first. These two forces ar e always equal in magnitude but opposite in dir ection. These for ces act on dif ferent objects and never on the same object. In the game of football sometimes we, while looking at the football and trying to kick it with a gr eater for ce, collide with a player of the opposite team. Both feel hurt because each applies a for ce to the other . In other wor ds, ther e is a pair of forces and not just one for ce. The two opposing for ces ar e also known as action and reaction for ces. Let us consider two spring balances connected together as shown in Fig. 8.10. The fixed end of balance B is attached with a rigid support, like a wall. When a for ce is applied through the fr ee end of spring balance A, it is observed that both the spring balances show the same r eadings on their scales. It means that the 
rigid support, like a wall. When a for ce is applied through the fr ee end of spring balance A, it is observed that both the spring balances show the same r eadings on their scales. It means that the for ce exerted by spring balance A on balance B is equal but opposite in dir ection to the for ce exerted by the balance B on balance A. Any of these two forces can be called as action  and the other as reaction . This gives us an alternative statement of the third law of motion i.e., to every action there is an equal and opposite r eaction. However , it must be remembered that the action and reaction always act on two different objects, simultaneously.Fig. 8.10: Action and reaction forces are equal and opposite. Suppose you are standing at rest and intend to start walking on a r oad. Y ou must accelerate, and this r equir es a for ce in accor dance with the second law of motion. Which is this for ce? Is it the muscular ef fort you exert on the r oad? Is it in the dir ection we intend to m
t accelerate, and this r equir es a for ce in accor dance with the second law of motion. Which is this for ce? Is it the muscular ef fort you exert on the r oad? Is it in the dir ection we intend to move? No, you push the r oad below backwar ds. The r oad exerts an equal and opposite force on your feet to make you move forward. It is important to note that even though the action and r eaction for ces ar e always equal in magnitude, these for ces may not produce accelerations of equal magnitudes. This is because each for ce acts on a dif ferent object that may have a dif ferent mass. When a gun is fir ed, it exerts a forwar d force on the bullet. The bullet exerts an equal and opposite force on the gun. This results in the recoil of the gun (Fig. 8.11). Since the gun has a much greater mass than the bullet, the acceleration of the gun is much less than the acceleration of the bullet. The third law of motion can also be illustrated when a sailor jumps out of a rowing boat. As the sailor 
 than the bullet, the acceleration of the gun is much less than the acceleration of the bullet. The third law of motion can also be illustrated when a sailor jumps out of a rowing boat. As the sailor jumps forward, the force on the boat moves it backwards (Fig. 8.12). Fig. 8.11: A forward force on the bullet and recoil of the gun.

Ancient Indian and Greek philosophers have always wonder ed about the unknown and unseen for m of matter . The idea of divisibility of matter was consider ed long back in India, around 500 BC. An Indian philosopher Maharishi Kanad, postulated that if we go on dividing matter ( padarth ), we shall get smaller and smaller particles. Ultimately, a stage will come when we shall come across the smallest particles beyond which further division will not be possible.  He named these particles Parmanu . Another Indian philosopher , Pakudha Katyayama, elaborated this doctrine and said that these particles nor mally exist in a combined for m which gives us various forms of matter . Around the same era, ancient Gr eek philosophers – Democritus and Leucippus suggested that if we go on dividing matter , a stage will come when particles obtained cannot be divided further . Democritus called these indivisible particles atoms (meaning indivisible). All this was based on philosophical considerations and
 a stage will come when particles obtained cannot be divided further . Democritus called these indivisible particles atoms (meaning indivisible). All this was based on philosophical considerations and not much experimental work to validate these ideas could be done till the eighteenth century. By the end of the eighteenth century, scientists r ecognised the dif ference between elements and compounds and naturally became inter ested in finding out how and why elements combine and what happens when they combine. Antoine L. Lavoisier laid the foundation of chemical sciences by establishing two important laws of chemical combination. 3.1Laws of Chemical Combination The following two laws of chemical combination were established aftermuch experimentations by Lavoisier and Joseph L.

Law of conservation of mass states that mass can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. 3.1.2 LAW OF CONSTANT  PROPORTIONS Lavoisier , along with other scientists, noted that many compounds were composed of two or more elements and each such compound had the same elements in the same proportions, irrespective of where the compound came from or who prepared it. In a compound such as water , the ratio of the mass of hydrogen to the mass of oxygen is always 1:8, whatever the sour ce of water . Thus, if 9 g of water 
e the compound came from or who prepared it. In a compound such as water , the ratio of the mass of hydrogen to the mass of oxygen is always 1:8, whatever the sour ce of water . Thus, if 9 g of water is decomposed, 1 g of hydrogen and 8 g of oxygen are always obtained. Similarly in ammonia, nitrogen and hydrogen are always present in the ratio 14:3 by mass, whatever the method or the source from which it is obtained. This led to the law of constant proportions which is also known as the law of definite proportions. This law was stated by Proust as “In a chemical substance the elements are always present in definite proportions by mass ”. The next problem faced by scientists was to give appropriate explanations of these laws. British chemist John Dalton provided the basic theory about the natur e of matter . Dalton picked up the idea of divisibility of matter , which was till then just a philosophy. He took the name ‘atoms’ as given by the Greeks and said that the smallest particles of

He took the name ‘atoms’ as given by the Greeks and said that the smallest particles of matter are atoms. His theory was based on the laws of chemical combination. Dalton’s atomic theory provided an explanation for the law ofconservation of mass and the law of definite proportions. John Dalton was born in a poor weaver’s family in 1766 in England. He began his car eer as a teacher at the age of twelve. Seven years later he became a school principal. In 1793, Dalton left for Manchester to teach mathematics, physics and chemistry in a college. He spent most of his life there teaching and researching. In 1808, he presented his atomic theory which was a turning point in the study of matter . According to Dalton’s atomic theory, all matter , whether an element, a compound or a mixtur e is composed of small particles called atoms. The postulates of this theory may be stated as foll
matter . According to Dalton’s atomic theory, all matter , whether an element, a compound or a mixtur e is composed of small particles called atoms. The postulates of this theory may be stated as follows: (i)All matter is made of very tiny particles called atoms, which participate in chemical reactions. (ii)Atoms are indivisible particles, which cannot be cr eated or destr oyed in a chemical r eaction. (iii) Atoms of a given element ar e identical in mass and chemical pr operties. (iv)Atoms of dif ferent elements have different masses and chemical properties. (v)Atoms combine in the ratio of small whole numbers to for m compounds. (vi)The r elative number and kinds of atoms are constant in a given compound. You will study in the next chapter that all atoms are made up of still smaller particles.  uestions 1.In a r eaction, 5.3 g of sodium carbonate reacted with 6 g of acetic acid.

Dalton was the first scientist to use the symbols for elements in a very specific sense. When he used a symbol for an element he also meant a definite quantity of that element, that is, one atom of that element. Berzilius suggested that the symbols of elements be made from one or two letters of the name of the element. Fig. 3.3: Symbols for some elements as pr oposed by Dalton Reprint 2025-26  [Source: iesc103.pdf - Page 3] ATOMS AND MOLECULES 29In the beginning, the names of elements were derived from the name of the place where they were found for the first time.

ND MOLECULES 29In the beginning, the names of elements were derived from the name of the place where they were found for the first time. For example, the name copper was taken from Cyprus. Some names were taken from specific colours. For example, gold was taken from the English word meaning yellow. Now-a-days, IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) is an international scientific organisation which approves names of elements, symbols and units. Many of the symbols are the first one or two letters of the element’s name in English. The first letter of a symbol is always written as a capital letter (uppercase) and the second letter as a small letter (lowercase). For example (i)hydrogen, H (ii)aluminium, Al and not AL (iii)cobalt, Co and not CO. Symbols of some elements are formed from the first letter of the name and a letter , appearing later in the name. Examples are: (i) chlorine, Cl, (ii) zinc, Zn etc. Other symbols have been taken from the names of elements in Latin
ormed from the first letter of the name and a letter , appearing later in the name. Examples are: (i) chlorine, Cl, (ii) zinc, Zn etc. Other symbols have been taken from the names of elements in Latin, German or Greek. For example, the symbol of iron is Fe from its Latin name ferrum, sodium is Na from natrium, potassium is K from kalium. Therefore, each element has a name and a unique chemical symbol. (The above table is given for you to refer to whenever you study about elements. Do not bother to memorise all in one go. With thepassage of time and repeated usage you will automatically be able to reproduce the symbols). 3.2.2 ATOMIC MASS The most remarkable concept that Dalton’s atomic theory proposed was that of the atomic mass. According to him, each element had a characteristic atomic mass. The theory could explain the law of constant proportions so well that scientists were prompted to measure the atomic mass of an atom. Since determining the mass of an individual atom was a relati
ass. The theory could explain the law of constant proportions so well that scientists were prompted to measure the atomic mass of an atom. Since determining the mass of an individual atom was a relatively difficult task, relative atomic masses were determined using the laws of chemical combinations and the compounds formed. Let us take the example of a compound, carbon monoxide (CO) formed by carbon and oxygen. It was observed experimentally that 3 g of carbon combines with 4 g of oxygen to form CO. In other words, carbon combines with 4/3 times its mass of oxygen. Suppose we define the atomic mass unit (earlier abbreviated as ‘amu’, but according to the latest IUPAC recommendations, it is now written as ‘u’ – unified mass) as equal to the mass of one carbon atom, then we would assign carbon an atomic mass of 1.0 u and oxygen an atomic mass of 1.33 u. However , it is more convenient to have these numbers asTable 3.1: Symbols for some elements Element Symbol Element Symbol Element Symbo

While sear ching for various atomic mass units, scientists initially took 1/ 16 of the mass of an atom of naturally occurring oxygen as the unit. This was consider ed relevant due to two r easons: •oxygen r eacted with a lar ge number of elements and for med compounds. •this atomic mass unit gave masses of most of the elements as whole numbers.

However , in 1961 for a universally accepted atomic mass unit, carbon-12 isotope was chosen as the standar d reference for measuring atomic masses. One atomic mass unit is a mass unit equal to exactly one-twelfth (1/12th) the mass of one atom of carbon-12. The r elative atomic masses of all elements have been found with r espect to an atom of carbon-12. Imagine a fruit seller selling fruits without any standard weight with him. He takes a water melon and says, “this has a mass equal to 12 units” (12 water melon units or 12 fruit mass units). He makes twelve equal pieces of the watermelon and finds the mass of each fruit he is selling, relative to the mass of one piece of the watermelon. Now he sells his fruits by relative fruit mass unit (fmu), as in Fig. 3.4. Fig. 3.4 : (a) W atermelon, (b) 12 pieces, (c) 1/12 of watermelon, (d) how the fruit seller can

Fig. 3.4 : (a) W atermelon, (b) 12 pieces, (c) 1/12 of watermelon, (d) how the fruit seller can weigh the fruits using pieces of watermelon Similarly, the relative atomic mass of the atom of an element is defined as the averagemass of the atom, as compared to 1/12th the mass of one carbon-12 atom.

A molecule is in general a group of two or more atoms that are chemically bonded together , that is, tightly held together by attractive forces. A molecule can be defined as the smallest particle of an element or a compound that is capable of an independent existence and shows all the properties of that substance. Atoms of the same element or of different elements can join together to form molecules.Q Reprint 2025-26  [Source: iesc103.pdf - Page 5] ATOMS AND MOLECULES 313.3.1 MOLECULES  OF  ELEMENTS The molecules of an element are constituted by the same type of atoms. Molecules of many elements, such as ar gon (Ar), helium (He) etc. are made up of only one atom of that element. But this is not the case with most of the non- metals. For example, a molecule of oxygen consists of two atoms of oxygen and hence it is known as a diatomic molecule, O2. If 3 atoms of oxygen uni

If 3 atoms of oxygen unite into a molecule, instead of the usual 2, we get ozone, O3. The number of atoms constituting a molecule is known as its atomicity. Metals and some other elements, such as carbon, do not have a simple structur e but consist of a very lar ge and indefinite number of atoms bonded together .

ng power (or capacity) of an element is known as its valency. V alency can be used to find out how the atoms of an element will combine with the atom(s) of another element to form a chemical compound. The valency of the atom of an element can be thought of as hands or arms of that atom. Human beings have two arms and an octopus has eight. If one octopus has to catch hold of a few people in such a manner that all the eight arms of the octopus and both arms of all the humans are locked, how many humans do you think the octopus can hold? Represent the octopus with O and humans with H. Can you write a formula for this combination? Do you get OH4 as the formula? The subscript 4 indicates the number of humans held by the octopus.

Formula of magnesium chloride Formula : MgCl2 Thus, in magnesium chloride, ther e are two chloride ions (Cl-) for each magnesium ion (Mg2+). The positive and negative char ges must balance each other and the overall structur e must be neutral. Note that in the formula, the charges on the ions are not indicated.

Y ou may arrive at the for mula Ca2O2. But we simplify the for mula as CaO.The rules that you have to follow while writing a chemical formula are as follows: •the valencies or charges on the ion must balance. •when a compound consists of a metal and a non-metal, the name or symbol of the metal is written first. For example: calcium oxide (CaO), sodium chloride (NaCl), iron sulphide (FeS), copper oxide (CuO), etc., where oxygen, chlorine, sulphur are non- metals  and are written on the right, whereas calcium, sodium, iron and copper are metals, and are written on the left. •in compounds formed with polyatomic ions, the number of ions present in the compound is indicated by enclosing the formula of ion in a bracket and writing the number of ions outside the bracket. For example, Mg (OH)2. In 
ith polyatomic ions, the number of ions present in the compound is indicated by enclosing the formula of ion in a bracket and writing the number of ions outside the bracket. For example, Mg (OH)2. In case the number of polyatomic ion is one, the bracket is not required. For example, NaOH. 3.4.1 FORMULAE  OF SIMPLE  COMPOUNDS The simplest compounds, which are made up of two different elements are called binary compounds. V alencies of some ions ar e given in Table 3.6. Y ou can use these to write formulae for compounds.

st particle comes back to its original position. This pr ocess continues in the medium till the sound r eaches your ear . The disturbance created by a source of  sound in the medium travels through the medium and not the particles of the medium. A wave is a disturbance that moves through a medium when the particles of the medium set neighbouring particles into motion. They in tur n produce similar motion in others. The particles of the medium do not move forwar d themselves, but the disturbance is carried forwar d. This is what happens during pr opagation of sound in a medium, hence sound can be visualised as a wave. Sound waves are characterised by the motion of particles in the medium and ar e called mechanical waves. Air is the most common medium thr ough which sound travels. When a vibrating object moves forward, it pushes and compresses the air in front of it creating a region of high pressur e. This r egion is called a compr ession (C), as shown in Fig. 11.4. This compression sta

This compression starts to move away from the vibrating object. When the vibrating object moves backwar ds, it creates a r egion of low pr essur e called rarefaction (R), as shown in Fig. 11.4. As the object moves back and forth rapidly, a series of compressions and rarefactions is created in the air . These make the sound wave thatFig. 11.3: Both the prongs of the vibrating tuning fork dipped in water From the above activities what do you conclude? Can you pr oduce sound without a vibrating object? In the above activities we have pr oduced sound by striking the tuning fork.

e slinky, you will observe that the dot on the slinky will move back and forth parallel to the direction of the propagation of the disturbance.The regions where the coils become closer are called compressions (C) and the regions where the coils are further apart are called rarefactions (R). As we already know, sound propagates in the medium as a series of compressions and rarefactions. Now, we can compare the propagation of disturbance in a slinky with the sound propagation in the medium. These waves are called longitudinal waves. In these waves the individual particles of the medium move in a direction parallel to the direction of propagation of the disturbance. The particles do not move from one place to another but they simply oscillate back and forth about their position of rest. This is exactly how a sound wave propagates, hence sound waves are longitudinal waves. There is also another type of wave, called a transverse wave.

is exactly how a sound wave propagates, hence sound waves are longitudinal waves. There is also another type of wave, called a transverse wave. In a transverse wave particles do not oscillate along the direction of wave propagation but oscillate up and down about their mean position as the wave travels. Thus, a transverse wave is the one in which the individual particles of the medium move about their mean positions in a direction perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. When we drop a pebble in a pond, the waves you see on the water surface is an example of transverse wave. Light is a transverse wave but for light, the oscillations are not of the medium particles or their pressure or density— it is not a mechanical wave. Y ou will come to know mor e about transverse waves in higher classes. 11.2.2 CHARACTERISTICS  OF A SOUND WAVE We can describe a sound wave by its •frequency •amplitude and •speed.Q A sound wave in graphic form is shown in Fig. 11.6(c), which represents how

the vibration of the source, the higher is the frequency and the higher is the pitch, as shown in Fig. 11.7. Thus, a high pitch sound corresponds to more number of compressions and rarefactions passing a fixed point per unit time. Objects of different sizes and conditions vibrate at different frequencies to produce sounds of different pitch. The magnitude of the maximum disturbance in the medium on either side of the mean value is called the amplitude of the wave. It is usually represented by the letter A,as shown in Fig. 11.6(c). For sound its unit will be that of density or pressure. The loudness or softness of a sound is determined basically by its amplitude. The amplitude of the sound wave depends upon the force with which an object is made to vibrate. If we strike a table lightly, we hear a soft sound because we produce a sound wavedensity of the medium oscillates between a maximum value and a minimum value. The change in density from the maximum value to the minimum value, then a
hear a soft sound because we produce a sound wavedensity of the medium oscillates between a maximum value and a minimum value. The change in density from the maximum value to the minimum value, then again to the maximum value, makes one complete oscillation. The number of such oscillations per unit time is the frequency of the sound wave. If we can count the number of the compressions or rarefactions that cross us per unit time, we will get the frequency of the sound wave. It is usually represented by n (Greek letter , nu). I ts SI unit is hertz (symbol, Hz). The time taken by two consecutive compressions or rarefactions to cross a fixed point is called the time period of the wave. In other words, we can say that the time taken for one complete oscillation is called the time period of the sound wave. It is represented by the symbol T. Its SI unit is second (s).

Frequency and time period are related as follows:      A violin and a flute may both be played at the same time in an orchestra. Both sounds travel through the same medium, that is, air and arrive at our ear at the same time. Both sounds travel at the same speed irrespective of the source. But the sounds we receive are different. This is due to the dif ferent characteristics associated with the sound. Pitch is one of the characteristics.=1vTFig. 11.7: Fig. 11.7:Fig. 11.7: Fig. 11.7:Fig. 11.7: Low pitch sound has low frequency and high pitch of sound has high frequency.

The speed of sound is defined as the distance which a point on a wave, such as a compression or a rarefaction, travels per unit time. We know, speed, v = distance / time = λ TExample 11.1 A sound wave has a frequency of 2 kHz and wave length 35 cm. How long will it take to travel 1.5 km? Solution: Given, Frequency, ν = 2 kHz = 2000 Hz Wavelength, λ = 35 cm = 0.35 m We know that speed, v of the wave = wavelength × frequency v= λ ν = 0.35 m  2000 Hz = 700 m/s The time taken by the wave to travel a distance, d of 1.5 km is Thus sound will take 2.1 s to travel a distance of 1.5 km. uestions 1.What ar e wavelength, fr equency, time period and amplitude of a sound wave? 2.How are the wavelength and frequency of a sound wave related to its speed? 3.Calculate the wavelength of a sound wave whose fr equency is 220 Hz and speed is 440 m/s

What is the time interval between successive compr essions from the source? The amount of sound energy passing each second through unit area is called the intensity of sound. W e sometimes use the ter ms “loudness” and “intensity” interchangeably, but they are not the same. Loudness is a measure of the response of the ear to the sound. Even when two sounds are of equal intensity, we may hear one as louder than the other simply because our ear detects it better .of less energy (amplitude). If we hit the table hard we hear a louder sound. Can you tell why? A sound wave spreads out from its source. As it moves away from the source its amplitude as well as its loudness de
ergy (amplitude). If we hit the table hard we hear a louder sound. Can you tell why? A sound wave spreads out from its source. As it moves away from the source its amplitude as well as its loudness decreases. Louder sound can travel a larger distance as it is associated with higher energy. Fig. 11.8 shows the wave shapes of a loud and a soft sound of the same frequency. The quality or timber of sound is that characteristic which enables us to distinguish one sound from another having the same pitch and loudness. The sound which is more pleasant is said to be of a rich quality. A sound of single frequency is called a tone. The sound which is produced due to a mixture of several frequencies is called a note and is pleasant to listen to. Noise is unpleasant to the ear! Music is pleasant to hear and is of rich quality. Here λ is the wavelength of the sound wave. It is the distance travelled by the sound wave in one time period ( T) of the wave. Thus, v = λ ν  or v = λ ν That is, speed = wa
ar and is of rich quality. Here λ is the wavelength of the sound wave. It is the distance travelled by the sound wave in one time period ( T) of the wave. Thus, v = λ ν  or v = λ ν That is, speed = wavelength × frequency. The speed of sound remains almost the same for all frequencies in a given medium under the same physical conditions.

The sound of a thunder is heard  a little later than the flash of light is seen. So, we can make out that sound travels with a speed which is much less than the speed of light. The speed of sound depends on the properties of the medium thr ough which it travels. Y ou will learn about this dependence in higher classes. The speed of sound in a medium depends on temperature of the medium. The speed of sound decreases when we go from solid to gaseous state. In any medium as we increase the temperature, the speed of sound increases. For example, the speed of sound in air is 331 m s–1 at 0 ºC and 344 m s–1 at 22 ºC.

s sound which we hear is called an echo. The sensation of sound persists in our brain for about 0.1 s. To hear a distinct echo the time interval between the original sound and the reflected one must be  at least 0.1s. If we take the speed of sound to be 344 m/s at a given temperatur e, say at 22 ºC in air , the sound must go to the obstacle and reach back the ear of the listener on reflection after 0.1s. Hence, the total distance covered by the sound from the point of generation to the reflecting surface and back should be at least (344 m/s) × 0.1 s = 34.4 m. Thus, for hearing distinct echoes, the minimum distance of the obstacle from the source of sound must be half of this distance, that is, 17.2 m. This distance will change with the temperatur e of air . Echoes may be hear d more than once due to successive or multiple reflections. The rolling of thunder is due to the successive reflections of the sound from a number of reflecting surfaces, such as the clouds and the land. 11.3.2 RE

The repeated reflection that results in this persistence of sound is called reverberation. In an auditorium or big hall excessive reverberation is highly undesirable. To reduce reverberation, the roof and walls of the auditorium are generally covered with sound-absorbent materials like compressed fibreboard, rough plaster or draperies. The seat materials are also selected on the basis of their sound absorbing properties. Example 11.2  A person clapped his hands near a cliff and heard the echo after 2 s.What is the distance of the cliff from the person if the speed of the sound, v is taken as 346 m s–1?

Solution: Given, Speed of sound, v = 346 m s–1 Time taken for hearing the echo, t = 2 s Distance travelled by the sound = v × t = 346 m s–1 × 2 s = 692 m In 2 s sound has to travel twice the distance between the cliff and the person.

Children under the age of five and some animals, such as dogs can hear up to 25 kHz (1 kHz = 1000 Hz). As people grow older their ears become less sensitive to higher frequencies. Sounds of frequencies below 20 Hz are called infrasonic sound or infrasound. If we could hear infrasound w

If we could hear infrasound we would hear the vibrations of a pendulum just as we hear the vibrations of the wings of a bee. Rhinoceroses communicate using infrasound of frequency as low as 5 Hz. Whales and elephants produce sound in the infrasound range. It is observed that some animals get disturbed before earthquakes. Earthquakes produce low-frequency infrasound before the main shock waves begin which possibly alert the animals. Frequencies higher than 20 kHz are called ultrasonic sound or ultrasound. Ultrasound is produced by animals such as dolphins, bats and porpoises. Moths of certain families have very sensitive hearing equipment.

complete oscillations per unit time is called the frequency (ν ), 1=v.T • The speed v, frequency ν, and wavelength λ, of sound are related by the equation, v  = λν. • The speed of sound depends primarily on the nature and the temperature of the transmitting medium. • The law of reflection of sound states that the directions in which the sound is incident and reflected make equal angles with the normal to the reflecting surface at the point of incidence and the three lie in the same plane. • For hearing a distinct sound, the time interval between the original sound and the reflected one must be at least 0.1 s. • The persistence of sound in an auditorium is the result of repeated reflections of sound and is called reverberation.These waves are then converted into electrical signals that are used to generate images of the organ.

As we look at our surr oundings, we see a lar ge variety of things with dif ferent shapes, sizes and textur es. Everything in this universe is made up of material which scientists have named “matter”. The air we br eathe, the food we eat, stones, clouds, stars, plants and animals, even a small dr op of water or a particle of sand — every thing is matter . We can also see as we look around that all the things mentioned above occupy space and have mass. In other words, they have both mass* and volume**. Since early times, human beings have been trying to understand their surr oundings. Early Indian philosophers  classified matter in the form of five basic elements — the “Panch Tatva” — air , earth, fir e, sky and water . According to them everything, living or non- living, was made up of these five basic elements. Ancient Gr eek philosophers had arrived at a similar classification of matter . Moder n day scientists have evolved two types of classification of matter based on their physica

Moder n day scientists have evolved two types of classification of matter based on their physical properties and chemical natur e. In this chapter we shall lear n about matter based on its physical pr operties. Chemical aspects of matter will be taken up in subsequent chapters. 1.1  Physical Nature of Matter 1.1.1 M ATTER  IS MADE  UP OF PARTICLES For a long time, two schools of thought prevailed regarding the natur e of matter . One school believed matter to be continuous like a block of wood, wher eas, the other thought that matter was made up of particles like sand. Let us perform an activity to decide about the natur e of matter  — is it continuous or particulate?Activity ______________ 1.1 •Take a 100 mL beaker . •Fill half the beaker with water and mark the level of water . •Dissolve some salt/ sugar with the help of a glass r od. •Observe any change in water level. •What do yo

In or der to answer these questions we need to use the idea that matter is made up of particles. What was ther e in the spoon,  salt or sugar , has now spr ead thr oughout  water .

With every dilution, though the colour becomes light, it is still visible. This experiment shows that just a few crystals of potassium per manganate can colour a lar ge volume of water (about 1000 L).

W e can see that matter ar ound us exists in thr ee dif ferent states– solid, liquid and gas. These states of matter arise due to the variation in the characteristics of the particles of matter . Now, let us study about the pr operties of these thr ee states of matter in detail. 1.3.1 THE SOLID  STATE Activity _____________  1.9 •Collect the following articles — a pen, a book, a needle and a piece of wooden stick. •Sketch the shape of the above articles in your notebook by moving a pencil around them. •Do all these have a definite shape, distinct boundaries and a fixed volume? •What happens

Ar e you able to compr ess them? All the above ar e examples of solids. W e can observe that all these have a definite shape, distinct boundaries and fixed volumes, that is, have negligible compr essibility. Solids have a tendency to maintain their shape when subjected to outside for ce. Solids may br eak under for ce but it is dif ficult to change their shape, so they ar e rigid. Consider the following: (a)What about a rubber band, can it change its shape on str etching? Is it a solid? (b)What about sugar and salt? When kept in dif ferent jars these take the shape of the jar . Are they solid? (c)What about a sponge? It is a solid yet we ar e able to compr e
r etching? Is it a solid? (b)What about sugar and salt? When kept in dif ferent jars these take the shape of the jar . Are they solid? (c)What about a sponge? It is a solid yet we ar e able to compr ess it. Why? All the above ar e solids as: •A rubber band changes shape under force and regains the same shape whenthe force is removed. If excessive force is applied, it breaks. •The shape of each individual sugar or salt crystal r emains fixed, whether we take it in our hand, put it in a plate or in a jar. •A sponge has minute holes, in which air is trapped, when we pr ess it, the air is expelled out and we ar e able to compr ess it. 1.3.2 THE LIQUID  STATE Activity _____________ 1.10 •Collect the following: (a)water , cooking oil, milk, juice, a cold drink.

Put a 50 mL mark on these containers using a measuring cylinder fr om the laboratory. •What will happen if these liquids ar e spilt on the floor? •Measur e 50 mL of any one liquid and transfer it into dif ferent containers one by one. Does the volume r emain the same? •Does the shape of the liquid r emain the same ? •When you pour the liquid fr om one container into another , does it flow easily? We observe that liquids have no fixed shape but have a fixed volume. They take up the shape of the container in which they ar e kept. Liquids flow and change shape, so they are not rigid but can be called fluid. Refer  to activities 1.4 and 1.5 wher e we saw that solids and liquids can dif fuse into liquids. The gases fr om the atmosphere diffuse and dissolve in water . These gases, especially oxygen and carbon dioxide, ar e essential for the survival of aquatic animals and plants. All living cr eatur es need to br eathe for survival. The aquatic animals can br eathe under water due to the p
xygen and carbon dioxide, ar e essential for the survival of aquatic animals and plants. All living cr eatur es need to br eathe for survival. The aquatic animals can br eathe under water due to the pr esence of dissolved oxygen  in water . Thus, we may conclude that solids, liquids and gases can diffuse into liquids. The rate of diffusion of liquids is Reprint 2025-26  [Source: iesc101.pdf - Page 4] MATTER IN OUR SURROUNDING S 5higher  than that of solids.  This is due to the fact that in the liquid state, particles move freely and have greater space between each other as compared to particles in the solid state. 1.3.3 THE GASEOUS  STATE Have you ever observed a balloon seller filling a lar ge number of balloons fr om a single cylinder of gas? Enquire fr om him how many balloons is he able to fill fr om one cylinder . Ask him which gas does he have in the cylinder .

Compr essed natural gas (CNG) is used as fuel these days in vehicles. Due to its high compr essibility, large volumes of a gas can be compr essed into a small cylinder and transported easily. We  c

We  come to know of what is being cooked in the kitchen without even entering ther e, by the smell that r eaches our nostrils. How does this smell reach us? The particles of the aroma of food mix with the particles of air spread fr om the kitchen, r each us and even farther away. The smell of hot cooked food reaches us in seconds; compare this with the rate of dif fusion of solids and liquids. Due to high speed of particles and lar ge space between   them, gases show the pr operty of diffusing very fast into other gases. In the gaseous state, the particles move about randomly at high speed. Due to this random movement, the particles hit each other and also the walls of the container .

On increasing the temperatur e of solids, the kinetic ener gy of the particles incr eases. Due to the incr ease in kinetic ener gy, the particles start vibrating with gr eater speed. The ener gy supplied by heat overcomes the forces of attraction between the particles. The particles leave their fixed positions and start moving mor e freely. A stage is reached when the solid melts and is converted to a liquid. The minimum temperature at which a solid melts to become a liquid at the atmospheric pressure is called its melting point. The melting point of a solid is an indication of the strength of the force of attraction between its particles. The melting point of ice is 273.15 K *.
tmospheric pressure is called its melting point. The melting point of a solid is an indication of the strength of the force of attraction between its particles. The melting point of ice is 273.15 K *. The process of melting, that is, change of solid state into liquid state is also known as fusion. When a solid melts, its temperature remains the same, so where does the heat energy go? You must have observed, during the experiment of melting, that the temperatur e of the system does not change after the melting point is reached, till all the ice melts. This happens even though we continue to heat the beaker, that is, we continue to supply heat. This heat gets used up in changing thestate by overcoming the forces of attraction between the particles. As this heat energy is absorbed by ice without showing any rise in temperatur e, it is consider ed that it gets hidden into the contents of the beaker and is known as the latent heat. The wor d latent means hidden. The amount of heat ener gy t
out showing any rise in temperatur e, it is consider ed that it gets hidden into the contents of the beaker and is known as the latent heat. The wor d latent means hidden. The amount of heat ener gy that is r equir ed to change 1 kg of a solid into liquid at atmospheric pr essur e at its melting point is known as the latent heat of fusion. So, particles in water at 0oC (273 K) have more energy as compared to particles in ice at the same temperature. When we supply heat ener gy to water , particles start moving even faster .  At a certain temperatur e, a point is r eached when the particles have enough energy to break fr ee from the forces of attraction of each other . At this temperatur e the liquid starts changing into gas. The temperature at which a liquid starts boiling at the atmospheric pr essur e is known as its boiling point. Boiling is a bulk phenomenon. Particles fr om the bulk of the liquid gain enough ener gy to change into the vapour state. For water this temperature is 373
ic pr essur e is known as its boiling point. Boiling is a bulk phenomenon. Particles fr om the bulk of the liquid gain enough ener gy to change into the vapour state. For water this temperature is 373 K (100oC = 273 + 100 = 373 K). Can you define the latent heat of vaporisation? Do it in the same way as we have defined the latent heat of fusion. Particles in steam, that is, water vapour at 373 K (1000 C) have mor e ener gy than water at the same temperatur e. This is because particles in steam have absorbed extra ener gy in the for m of latent heat of vaporisation. *Note: Kelvin is the SI unit of temperature, 0o C =273.15 K. For convenience, we take 0o C = 273 K after rounding off the decimal. To change a temperature on the Kelvin scale to the Celsius scale you have to subtract 273 from the given temperature, and to convert a temperature on the Celsius scale to the Kelvin scale you have to add 273 to the given temperature.So, we infer that the state of matter can be changed into anothe
e given temperature, and to convert a temperature on the Celsius scale to the Kelvin scale you have to add 273 to the given temperature.So, we infer that the state of matter can be changed into another state by changing the temperature. We have lear nt that substances ar ound us change state fr om solid to liquid and fr om liquid to gas on application of heat.

Have you hear d of solid carbon dioxide (CO2)? It is stor ed  under high pr essur e. Solid CO2 gets converted directly into gaseous state on decr ease of pr essur e to 1 atmospher e* without coming into liquid state. This is the reason that solid carbon dioxide is also known as dry ice. Thus, we can say that pr essur e and temperature deter mine the state of a substance, whether it will be solid, liquid or

Can you quote some examples from everyday life where change of state from liquid to vapour takes place without the liquid reaching the boiling point? W ater, when left uncovered, slowly changes into vapour . Wet clothes dry up. What happens to water in the above two examples? We know that particles of matter are always moving and are never at rest. At a given temperature in any gas, liquid or solid, there are particles with different amounts of kinetic energy. In the case of liquids, a small fraction of particles at the surface, having higher kinetic energy, is able to break away from the forces of attraction of other
th different amounts of kinetic energy. In the case of liquids, a small fraction of particles at the surface, having higher kinetic energy, is able to break away from the forces of attraction of other particles and gets converted into vapour . This phenomenon of change of  liquid into vapours at any temperature below its boiling point is called evaporation. 1.5.1 FACTORS  AFFECTING  EVAPORATION Let us understand this with an activity .

In everyday life, we see some objects at r est and others in motion. Bir ds fly, fish swim, blood flows through veins and arteries, and cars move. Atoms, molecules, planets, stars and galaxies ar e all in motion. W e often perceive an object to be in motion when its position changes with time. However , ther e are situations wher e the motion is inferr ed through indir ect evidences. For example, we infer the motion of air by observing the movement of dust and the movement of leaves and branches of tr ees. What causes the phenomena of sunrise, sunset and changing of seasons? Is it due to the motion of the earth? If it is true, why don’t we dir ectly perceive the motion of the earth? An object may appear to be moving for one person and stationary for some other .

Some objects may move in a straight line, others may take a circular path. Some may r otate and a few others may vibrate. Ther e may be situations involving a combination of these. In this chapter , we shall first lear n to describe the motion of objects along a straight line. W e shall also lear n to expr ess such  motions through simple equations and graphs. Later , we shall discuss ways of describing circular motion.Activity ______________ 7.1 •Discuss whether the walls of your classr oom ar e at r est or in motion.

Do you feel the necessity to study the erratic motion of some objects and learn to control them? 7.1Describing Motion We describe the location of an object by specifying a r eference point. Let us understand this by an example. Let us assume that a school in a village is 2 km north of the railway station. W e have specified the position of the school with r espect to the railway station. In this example, the railway station is the r eference point. W e could have also chosen other r efer

W e shall first lear n to describe this by an example. Consider the motion of an object moving along a straight path. The object starts its jour ney fr om O which is tr eated as its r eference point (Fig. 7.1). Let A, B and C represent the position of the object at different instants. At first, the object moves through C and B and reaches A. Then it moves back along the same path and reaches C through B. are used to describe the overall motion of an obje

This is the distance cover ed by the object. T o describe distance we need to specify only the numerical value and not the dir ection of motion. Ther e are certain quantities which are described by specifying only their numerical values. The numerical value of a physical quantity is its magnitude. Fr om this example, can you find out the distance of the final position C of the object fr om the initial position O? This dif ference will give you the numerical value of the displacement of the object fr om O to C thr ough A. The shortest distance measur ed from the initial to the final position of an object is known as the displacement. Can the magnitude of the displacement be equal to the distance travelled by an object? Consider
est distance measur ed from the initial to the final position of an object is known as the displacement. Can the magnitude of the displacement be equal to the distance travelled by an object? Consider the example given in (Fig. 7.1). For motion of the object from O to A,  the distance covered is 60 km  and the magnitude of displacement is also 60 km. During its motion from O to A and back to B, the distance coveredFig. 7.1:  Positions of an object on a straight line path= 60 km + 25 km = 85 km while the magnitude of displacement = 35 km. Thus, the magnitude of displacement (35 km) is not equal to the path length (85 km). Further , we will notice that the magnitude of the displacement for a course of motion may be zero but the corresponding distance covered is not zero. If we consider the object to travel back to O, the final position concides with the initial position, and therefore, the displacement is zer o. However , the distance covered in this journey is OA + AO = 60 km + 60 km = 
bject to travel back to O, the final position concides with the initial position, and therefore, the displacement is zer o. However , the distance covered in this journey is OA + AO = 60 km + 60 km = 120 km.

Let it travel 5 m in the first second, 5 m mor e in the next second , 5 m in the third second  and 5 m in the fourth second . In this case, the object covers 5 m in each second. As the object covers equal distances in equal intervals of time, it is said to be in unifor m motion. The time interval in this motion should be small. In our day-to-day life, we come acr oss motions wher e objects cover unequal distances in equal intervals of time, for example, when a car is moving on a cr owded str eet or a person is jogging in a park. These ar e some instances of non-unifor m motion.

If the bowling speed is 143 km h–1 in Fig. 7.2(a) what does it mean? What do you understand from the signboard in Fig. 7.2(b)? Different objects may take dif ferent amounts of time to cover a given distance. Some of them move fast and some move slowly.  The rate at which objects move can be dif ferent. Also, dif fer ent objects can move at the same rate. One of the ways of measuring the rate of motion of an object is to find out the distance travelled by the object in unit time. This quantity is r eferred to as speed. The SI unit of spe

The SI unit of speed is metr e per second. This is r epresented by the symbol m s–1 or m/s. The other units of speed include centimetr e per second (cm s–1) and kilometr e per hour (km h–1). To specify the speed of an object, we r equir e only its magnitude. The speed of an object need not be constant. In most cases, objects will be in non-uniform motion. Ther efore, we describe the rate of motion of such objects in ter ms of their average speed. The average speed of an object is obtained by dividing the total distance travelled by the total time taken. That is, average speed = Total distance travelled Total time taken If an object travels a distance s in time t then its speed v is, v = s t(7.1) Let us understand this by an example. A car travels a distance of 100 km in 2 h. Its average speed is 50 km h–1. 
me taken If an object travels a distance s in time t then its speed v is, v = s t(7.1) Let us understand this by an example. A car travels a distance of 100 km in 2 h. Its average speed is 50 km h–1. The car might not have travelled at 50 km h–1 all the time. Sometimes it might have travelled faster and sometimes slower than this. Example 7.1  An object travels 16 m in 4 s and then another 16 m in 2 s. What is the average speed of the object? Solution: Total distance travelled by the object = 16 m + 16 m = 32 m Total time taken = 4 s + 2 s = 6 sAverage speed =  Total distance travelled Total time taken = 32 m 6 s= 5.33 m s–1 Therefore, the average speed of the object is 5.33 m s–1. 7.2.1 SPEED WITH DIRECTION The rate of motion of an object can be mor e compr ehensive if we specify its dir ection of motion along with its speed. The quantity that specifies both these aspects is called velocity. Velocity is the speed of an object moving in a definite dir ection. The velocity of an object 
ection of motion along with its speed. The quantity that specifies both these aspects is called velocity. Velocity is the speed of an object moving in a definite dir ection. The velocity of an object can be unifor m or variable. It can be changed by changing the object’s speed, dir ection of motion or both. When an object is moving along a straight line at a variable speed, we can expr ess the magnitude of its rate of motion in ter ms of average velocity. It is calculated in the same way as we calculate average speed. In case the velocity of the object is changing at a unifor m rate, then average velocity is given by the arithmetic mean of initial velocity and final velocity for a given period of time. That is, average velocity = initialvelocity + finalvelocity 2 Mathematically, v av  = u + v 2(7.2) where vav is the average velocity, u is the initial velocity and v is the final velocity of the object.

In this case, the change in velocity of the object for any time interval is zero. However , in non-uniform motion, velocity varies with time.

hysical quantity called acceleration, which is a measure of the change in the velocity of an object per unit time. That is, acceleration  =change in velocity time taken If the velocity of an object changes from an initial value u to the final value v in time t, the acceleration a is, v – u a = t(7.3) This kind of motion is known as accelerated motion. The acceleration is taken to be positive if it is in the direction of velocity and negative when it is opposite to the direction of velocity . The SI unit of acceleration is m s–2 . If an object travels in a straight line and its velocity increases or decreases by equal amounts in equal intervals of time, then the acceleration of the object is said to be uniform. The motion of a fre ely falling body is an example of uniformly accelerated motion. On the other hand, an object can travel with non-uniform acceleration if its velocity changes at a non-uniform rate. F or example, if a car travelling along a straight road increases its spe ed by

For example, in the telecast of a one-day cricket match, vertical bar graphs show the run rate of a team in each over . As you have studied in mathematics, a straight line graph helps in solving a linear equation having two variables. To describe the motion of an object, we can use line graphs. In this case, line graphs show dependence of one physical quantity, such as distance or velocity, on another quantity, such as time. 7.4.1 DISTANCE –TIME GRAPHS The change in the position of an object with time can be represented on the distance-t
e physical quantity, such as distance or velocity, on another quantity, such as time. 7.4.1 DISTANCE –TIME GRAPHS The change in the position of an object with time can be represented on the distance-time graph adopting a convenient scale of choice. In this graph, time is taken along the x–axis and distance is taken along the y-axis. Distance-time graphs can be employed under various conditions where objects move with uniform speed, non-uniform speed, remain at rest etc. Fig. 7.3: Fig. 7.3:Fig. 7.3: Fig. 7.3:Fig. 7.3: Distance-time graph of an object moving with unifor m speed We know that when an object travels equal distances in equal intervals of time, it moves with uniform speed. This shows that thedistance travelled by the object is directly proportional to time taken. Thus, for uniform speed, a graph of distance travelled against time is a straight line, as shown in Fig. 7.3. The portion OB of the graph shows that the distance is increasing at a uniform rate.

N ote that, you can also use the term uniform velocity in place of uniform spe ed if you take the magnitude of displacement equal to the distance travelled by the object along the y-axis. We can use the distance-time graph to determine the spe ed of an object. T o do so, consider a small part AB of the distance-time graph shown in Fig 7.3. Draw a line parallel to the x- axis from point A and another line parallel to the y-axis from point B . These two lines me et each other at point C to form a triangle ABC. Now, on the graph, A C denotes the time interval ( t2 – t1) while BC corresponds to the distance ( s2 – s1). We can se e from the graph that as the object moves from the point A to B, it covers a distance ( s2 – s1) in time (t2 – t1). The spe ed, v of the object, therefore can be represented as   = 2 1 2 1
. We can se e from the graph that as the object moves from the point A to B, it covers a distance ( s2 – s1) in time (t2 – t1). The spe ed, v of the object, therefore can be represented as   = 2 1 2 1– –s s t t(7.4) We can also plot the distance-time graph for accelerated motion.

Note that the shape of this graph is dif ferent fr om the earlier distance-time graph (Fig. 7.3) for uniform motion. The natur e of this graph shows non- linear variation of the distance travelled by the car with time. Thus, the graph shown in Fig 7.4 represents motion with non-uniform speed. 7.4.2 V ELOCITY -TIME GRAPHS The variation in velocity with time for an object moving in a straight line can be represented by a velocity-time graph.

7.5: Velocity-time graph for unifor m motion of a caris represented along the y-axis. If the object moves at uniform velocity, the height of its velocity-time graph will not change with time (Fig. 7.5). It will be a straight line parallel to the x-axis. Fig. 7.5 shows the velocity-time graph for a car moving with uniform velocity of 40 km h–1. We know that the pr oduct of velocity and time give displacement of an object moving with unifor m velocity. The ar ea enclosed by velocity-time graph and the time axis will be equal to the magnitude of the displacement. To know the distance moved by the car between time  t1 and t2 using Fig. 7.5, draw perpendiculars fr om the points corr esponding to the time t1 and t2 on the graph. The velocity of 40 km h–1 is repr esented by the height AC or BD and the time ( t2 – t1) is represented by the length AB. So, the distance s moved by the car in time ( t2 – t1) can be expr essed as s=AC × CD =[(40 km h–1) × (t2 – t1) h] =40 (t2– t1) km =area of the r

We can also study about unifor mly accelerated motion by plotting its velocity– time graph. Consider a car being driven along a straight r oad for testing its engine. Suppose a person sitting next to the driver r ecords its velocity after every 5 seconds by noting the reading of the speedometer of the car .

The ar ea under the velocity-time graph gives the distance (magnitude of displacement) moved by the car in a given interval of time. If the car would have been moving with unifor m velocity, the distance travelled by it would be r epresented by the ar ea ABCD under the graph (Fig. 7.6).

For convenience, a set of three such equations are given below: v=u + at (7.5) s=ut + ½ at2(7.6) 2 as = v2 – u2(7.7) where u is the initial velocity of the object which moves with uniform acceleration a for time t, v is the final velocity, and s is the distance travelled by the object in time t. Eq. (7.5) describes the velocity-time relation and Eq. (7.6) represents the position-time relation. Eq.

The change in the velocity could be due to change in its magnitude or the direction of the motion or both.

How many times will the athlete have to change his direction of motion, while he completes one round? It is clear that to move in a rectangular track once, he has to change his direction of motion four times. Now, suppose instead of a rectangular track, the athlete is running along a hexagonal shaped path ABCDEF , as shown in Fig. 7.8(b). In this situation, the athlete will have to change his direction six times while he  completes one round. What if the track was not a hexagon but a regular octagon, with eight equal sides as shown by ABCDEFGH in Fig. 7.8(c)?  It is observed that as the number of sides of the track increases the athelete has to take turns more and more often. What would happen to the shape of the track as we go on increasing the number of sides indefinitely? If you do this you wi
es of the track increases the athelete has to take turns more and more often. What would happen to the shape of the track as we go on increasing the number of sides indefinitely? If you do this you will notice that the shape of the track approaches the shape of a circle and the length of each of the sides will decrease to a point. If the athlete moves with a velocity of constant magnitude along the circular path, the only change in his velocity is due to the change in the direction of motion. The motion of the athlete moving along a circular path is, therefore, an example of an accelerated moti on. We know  that the cir cumfer ence of a cir cle of radius r is given by  π2 r. If the athlete takes t seconds to go once around the circular path of radius r, the speed v is given by π2 rv = t (7.8) When an object moves in a circular path with uniform speed, its motion is called uniform circular motion.(a) Rectangular track (b) Hexagonal track (d) A cir cular track (c) Octagonal shaped track

g. 7.9.If you carefully note, on being released the stone moves along a straight line tangential to the circular path. This is because once the stone is released, it continues to move along the direction it has been moving at that instant. This shows that the direction of motion changed at every point when the stone was moving along the circular path. When an athlete throws a hammer or a discus in a sports meet, he/she holds the hammer or the discus in his/her hand and gives it a circular motion by rotating his/ her own body. Once released in the desired direction, the hammer or discus moves in the direction in which it was moving at the time it was released, just like the piece of stone in the activity described above.

While examining a thin slice of cork, Robert Hooke saw that the cork r esembled the structur e of a honeycomb consisting of many little compartments. Cork is  a substance which comes fr om the bark of a tr ee. This was in the year 1665 when Hooke made this chance observation thr ough a self-designed microscope. Robert Hooke called these boxes cells. Cell is a Latin word for ‘a little r oom’. This may seem to be a very small and insignificant incident but it is very important in the history of science. This was the very first time that someone had observed that living things appear to consist of separate units. The use of the word ‘cell’ to describe these units is being used till this day in biology. Let us find out about cells. 5.1What are Living Organisms Made Up of?

These small structures that we see ar e the basic building units of the onion bulb. These structur es ar e called cells. Not only onions, but all or ganisms that we observe around ar e made up of cells. However , ther e are also single cells that live on their own. Cells wer e first discover ed by Robert Hooke  in 1665. He observed the cells in a cork slice with the help of a primitive micr oscope. Leeuwenhoek (1674), with the improved micr oscope, discover ed the free living cells in pond water for the first time.  It was Robert Br own in 1831 who discovered the nucleus in the cell.   Purkinje in 1839 coined the term ‘pr otoplasm’ for the fluid substance of the cell. The cell theory, that all the plants and animals are composed of cells and that the cell is the basic unit of life, was pr esented by two biologists, Schleiden (1838) and  Schwan n (1

The cell theory, that all the plants and animals are composed of cells and that the cell is the basic unit of life, was pr esented by two biologists, Schleiden (1838) and  Schwan n (1839). The cell theory was further expanded by V irchow (1855) by suggesting  that all cells arise  fr om pr e-existing cells.  W ith the discovery of the electr on micr oscope in 1940, it was possible to observe and understand the complex structur e of the cell and its various or ganelles. The invention of magnifying lenses led to the discovery of the micr oscopic world.

In some cases the cell shape could be mor e or less fixed and peculiar for a particular type of cell; for example, nerve cells have a typical shape. Each living cell has the capacity to perform certain basic functions that ar e characteristic of all living for ms. How does a living cell per form these basic functions? We know that ther e is a division of labour in multicellular or ganisms such as human beings. This means that dif ferent parts of the human body per form dif ferent functions. The human body has a heart to pump blood, a stomach to digest food and so on. Similarly, division of labour is also seen within a single cell. In fact, each such cell has got certain specific components within it known as cell organelles. Each kind of cell or ganelle performs a special function, such as making new material in the cell, clearing up the waste material fr om the cell and so on. A cell is able to live and 
cell organelles. Each kind of cell or ganelle performs a special function, such as making new material in the cell, clearing up the waste material fr om the cell and so on. A cell is able to live and per form all its functions because of these or ganelles. These organelles together constitute the basic unit called the cell. It is inter esting that all cells are found to have the same or ganelles, no matter what their function is or what organism they ar e found in. uestions 1.Who discovered cells, and how? 2.Why is the cell called the structural and functional unit of life? 5.2What is a Cell Made Up of? What is the Structural Organisation of a Cell? We saw above that the cell has special components called or ganelles. How is a cell organised?

 come across thr ee featur es in almostevery cell; plasma membrane, nucleus and cytoplasm. All activities inside the cell and interactions of the cell with its envir onment are possible due to these featur es. Let us see how. 5.2.1 PLASMA  MEMBRANE  OR CELL MEMBRANE This is the outer most covering of the cell that separates the contents of the cell fr om its external envir onment. The plasma membrane allows or per mits the entry and exit of some materials in and out of the cell. It also prevents movement of some other materials. The cell membrane, ther efore, is called a selectively per meable membrane. How does the movement of substances take place into the cell? How do substances move out of the cell? Some substances like carbon dioxide or oxygen can move acr oss the cell membrane by a pr ocess called dif fusion. W e have studied the pr ocess of dif fusion in earlier chapters. We saw that there is spontaneous movement of a substance fr om a r egion of high concentration to a r egion 
r ocess called dif fusion. W e have studied the pr ocess of dif fusion in earlier chapters. We saw that there is spontaneous movement of a substance fr om a r egion of high concentration to a r egion wher e its concentration is low. Something similar to this happens in cells when, for example, some substance like CO2 (which is cellular waste and r equir es to be excreted out by the cell) accumulates in high concentrations inside the cell. In the cell’s exter nal envir onment, the concentration of CO2 is low as compar ed to that inside the cell. As soon as ther e is a dif ference of concentration of CO2 inside and outside a cell, CO2 moves out of the cell, fr om a r egion of high concentration, to a r egion of low concentration outside the cell by the pr ocess of dif fusion. Similarly, O2 enters the cell by the pr ocess of dif fusion when the level or concentration of O2 inside the cell decreases. Thus, dif fusion plays an important r ole in gaseous exchange between the cells as well as
nters the cell by the pr ocess of dif fusion when the level or concentration of O2 inside the cell decreases. Thus, dif fusion plays an important r ole in gaseous exchange between the cells as well as the cell and its exter nal envir onment. Water also obeys the law of dif fusion. The movement of water molecules through such a selectively permeable membrane is called osmosis.Q Reprint 2025-26  [Source: iesc105.pdf - Page 3] SCIENCE 52 52525252The movement of water across the plasma membrane is also affected by the amount of substance dissolved in water. Thus, osmosis is the net diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane toward a higher solute concentration . What will happen if we put an animal cell or a plant cell into a solution of sugar or salt in water? One of the following thr ee things could happen: 1.If the medium surrounding the cell has a higher water concentration than the cell, meaning that the outside solution is very dilute, the cell will gain water by osmo
wing thr ee things could happen: 1.If the medium surrounding the cell has a higher water concentration than the cell, meaning that the outside solution is very dilute, the cell will gain water by osmosis. Such a solution is known as a hypotonic solution. Water molecules are free to pass across the cell membrane in both directions, but more water will come into the cell than will leave. The net (overall) result is that water enters the cell. The cell is likely to swell up. 2.If the medium has exactly the same water concentration as the cell, there will be no net movement of water across the cell membrane. Such a solution is known as an isotonic solution. Water crosses the cell membrane in both directions, but the amount going in is the same as the amount going out, so there is no overall movement of water. The cell will stay the same size. 3.If the medium has a lower concentration of water than the cell, meaning that it is a very concentrated solution, the cell will lose water by osmosi
vement of water. The cell will stay the same size. 3.If the medium has a lower concentration of water than the cell, meaning that it is a very concentrated solution, the cell will lose water by osmosis. Such a solution is known as a hypertonic solution. Again, water cr osses the cell membrane in both dir ections, but this time mor e water leaves the cell than enters it. Ther efore the cell will shrink. Thus, osmosis is a special case of dif fusion through a selectively permeable membrane. Now let us try out the following activity:Activity ______________ 5.3 (a)Remove the shell of an egg by dissolving it in dilute hydrochloric acid. The shell is mostly calcium carbonate. A thin outer skin now encloses the egg. Put the egg in pure water and observe after 5 minutes. What do we observe? The egg swells because water passes into it by osmosis. (b)Place a similar de-shelled egg in a concentrated salt solution and observe for 5 minutes. The egg shrinks. Why? Water passes out of the egg solutio
g swells because water passes into it by osmosis. (b)Place a similar de-shelled egg in a concentrated salt solution and observe for 5 minutes. The egg shrinks. Why? Water passes out of the egg solution into the salt solution because the salt solution is mor e concentrated. We can also try a similar activity with dried raisins or apricots. Activity ______________ 5.4 •Put dried raisins or apricots in plain water and leave them for some time. Then place them into a concentrated solution of sugar or salt. Y ou will observe the following: (a)Each gains water and swells when placed in water . (b)However , when placed in the concentrated solution it loses water , and consequently shrinks. Unicellular freshwater organisms and most plant cells tend to gain water thr ough osmosis. Absorption of water by plant r oots is also an example of osmosis. Thus, dif fusion is important in exhange of gases and water in the life of a cell. In additions to this, the cell also obtains nutrition fr om its env
er by plant r oots is also an example of osmosis. Thus, dif fusion is important in exhange of gases and water in the life of a cell. In additions to this, the cell also obtains nutrition fr om its envir onment. Dif ferent molecules move in and out of the cell through a type of transport r equiring use of ener gy. The plasma membrane is flexible and is made up of or ganic molecules called lipids and pr oteins. However , we can observe the structur e of the plasma membrane only through an electr on micr oscope. The flexibility of the cell membrane also enables the cell to engulf in food and other material from its external environment. Such processes are known as endocytosis. Amoeba acquires its food through such processes.

Discuss. 2.Why is the plasma membrane called a selectively per meable membrane? 5.2.2 CELL WALL Plant cells, in addition to the plasma membrane, have another rigid outer covering called the cell wall. The cell wall lies outside the plasma membrane. The plant cell wall is mainly composed of cellulose. Cellulose is a complex substance and provides structural strength to plants. When a living plant cell loses water through osmosis ther e is shrinkage or contraction of the contents of the cell away from the cell wall. This phenomenon is known as plasmolysis. W e can observe this phenomenon by per forming the following activity: Activity ______________ 5.6 •Mount the peel of a Rhoeo leaf in water on a slide and examine cells under the high power

W ait for a minute and observe under a microscope. What do we see? •Now place some Rhoeo leaves in boiling water for a few minutes. This kills the cells. Then mount one leaf on a slide and observe it under a microscope. Put a strong solution of sugar or salt on the mounted leaf on the slide. Wait for a minute and observe it again. What do we find? Did plasmolysis occur now?What do we infer from this activity? It appears that only living cells, and not dead cells, are able to absorb water by osmosis.

ctivity? It appears that only living cells, and not dead cells, are able to absorb water by osmosis. Cell walls per mit the cells of plants, fungi and bacteria to withstand very dilute (hypotonic) exter nal media without bursting. In such media the cells tend to take up water by osmosis. The cell swells, building up pressur e against the cell wall. The wall exerts an equal pr essur e against the swollen cell. Because of their walls, such cells can withstand much gr eater changes in the surrounding medium than animal cells. 5.2.3 NUCLEUS Remember the temporary mount of onion peel we pr epared?

This structure is called nucleus. W ere ther e similar structur es in onion peel cells? The nucleus has a double layer ed covering called nuclear membrane. The nuclear membrane has por es which allow the transfer of material fr om inside the nucleus to its outside, that is, to the cytoplasm (which we will talk about in section 5.2.4). The nucleus contains chr omosomes, which ar e visible as r od-shaped structur es only when the cell is about to divide. Chromosomes contain infor mation for inheritance of characters from parents to next generation in the for m of DNA (Deoxyribo Nucleic Acid) molecules. Chr omosomes ar e composed of DNA and p

Chr omosomes ar e composed of DNA and pr otein. DNA molecules contain the infor mation necessary for constructing and or ganising cells. Functional segments of DNA are called genes. In a cell which is not dividing, this DNA is pr esent as part of chr omatin material. Chromatin material is visible as entangled mass of thr ead like structur es. Whenever the cell is about to divide, the chr omatin material gets or ganised into chr omosomes. The nucleus plays a central r ole in cellular reproduction, the pr ocess by which a single cell divides and for ms two new cells. It also plays a crucial part, along with the envir onment, in deter mining the way the cell will develop and what for m it will exhibit at maturity, by dir ecting the chemical activities of the cell.

In some or ganisms like bacteria, the nuclear r egion of the cell may be poorly defined due to the absence of a nuclear membrane. Such an undefined nuclear r egion containing only nucleic acids is called a nucleoid. Such or ganisms, whose cells lack a nuclear membrane, ar e called prokaryotes (Pro = primitive or primary; karyote ≈ karyon = nucleus). Or ganisms with cells having a nuclear membrane are called eukaryotes. Prokaryotic cells (see Fig. 5.4) also lack most of the other cytoplasmic organellespresent in eukaryotic cells. Many of the functions of such organelles are also performed by poorly or ganised parts of the cytoplasm (see section 5.2.4).

Lar ge and complex cells, including cells from multicellular or ganisms, need a lot of chemical activities to support their complicated structur e and function. T o keep these activities of dif ferent kinds separate fr om each other , these cells use membrane-bound little structures (or ‘organelles’) within themselves. This is one of the featur es of the eukaryotic cells that distinguish them fr om pr okaryotic cells. Some of these or ganelles ar e visible only with an electr on microscope.

It looks like long tubules or r ound or oblong bags (vesicles). The ER membrane is similar in structur e to the plasma membrane. There are two types of ER– r ough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER). RER looks rough under a microscope because it has particles called ribosomes attached to its sur face. The ribosomes, which ar e present in all active cells, ar e the sites of protein manufactur e.

The SER helps in the manufactur e of fat molecules, or lipids, important for cell function. Some of these proteins and lipids help in building the cell membrane. This pr ocess is known as membrane biogenesis. Some other pr oteins and lipids function as enzymes and hormones. Although the ER varies greatly in appearance in different cells, it always forms a network system.Q Fig. 5.5:  Animal cell Thus, one function of the ER is to serve as channels for the transport of materials (especially pr oteins) between various r egions of the cytoplasm or between the cytoplasm and the nucleus.

At that time most of his investigations were concerned with the nervous system, In 1872 he accepted the post of Chief Medical Officer at the Hospital for the Chronically Sick at Abbiategrasso.  He first started his investigations into the nervous system in a little kitchen of this hospital, which he had converted into a laboratory.

All through his life, he continued to work on these lines, modifying and improving this technique. Golgi received the highest honours and awards in recognition of his work. He shared the Nobel prize in 1906 with Santiago Ramony  Cajal for their work on the structure of the nervous system. 5.2.5 ( iii) LYSOSOMES Structurally, lysosomes are membrane-bound sacs filled with digestive enzymes. These enzymes ar e made by RER. L ysosomes ar e a kind of waste disposal system of the cell. These help to keep the cell clean by digesting any foreign material as well as worn-out cell organelles. Foreign materials entering the cell, such as bacteria or food, as well as old organelles end up in the lysosomes, which break complex substances into simpler substances.

The energy required for various chemical activities needed for life is released by mitochondria in the form of ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) molecules. ATP is known as the energy currency of the cell. The body uses energy stored in ATP for making new chemical compounds and for mechanical work. Mitochondria are strange organelles in the sense that they have their own DNA and ribosomes. Therefore, mitochondria are able to make some of their own proteins. 5.2.5 ( V) PLASTIDS Plastids are present only in plant cells. There are two types of plastids – chromoplasts (coloured plastids) and leucoplasts (white or colourless plastids). Chromoplasts containing the pigment chlorophyll are known as chloroplasts.

Chloroplasts also contain various yellow or orange pigments in addition to chlorophyll. Leucoplasts are primarily organelles in which materials such as starch, oils and protein granules are stored.

Like the mitochondria, plastids also have their own DNA and ribosomes. 5.2.5 ( vi) VACUOLES Vacuoles are storage sacs for solid or liquid contents.

From the last chapter , we r ecall that all living organisms ar e made of cells. In unicellular organisms, a single cell per forms all basic functions. For example, in Amoeba , a single cell carries out movement, intake of food, gaseous exchange and excretion. But in multi- cellular organisms there are millions of cells. Most of these cells are specialised to carry out specific functions. Each specialised function is taken up by a different group of cells. Since these cells carry out only a particular function, they do it very efficiently. In human beings, muscle cells contract and relax to cause movement, nerve cells carry messages, blood flows to transport oxygen, food, hormones and waste material and so on. In plants, vascular tissues conduct food and water from one part of the plant to other parts. So, multi-cellular organisms show division of labour . Cells specialising in one function are often grouped together in the body. This means that a particular function is carried out by 
 other parts. So, multi-cellular organisms show division of labour . Cells specialising in one function are often grouped together in the body. This means that a particular function is carried out by a cluster of cells at a definite place in the body. This cluster of cells, called a tissue, is arranged and designed so as to give the highest possible efficiency of function. Blood, phloem and muscle are all examples of tissues. A group of cells that are similar in structure and/or work together to achieve a particular function forms a tissue. 6.1Are Plants and Animals Made of Same Types of Tissues? Let us compar e their structur e and functions. Do plants and animals have the same structur e? Do they both per form similar functions?There are noticeable differences between the two. Plants are stationary or fixed – they don’t move. Since they have to be upright, they have a large quantity of supportive tissue. The supportive tissue generally has dead cells. Animals on the other hand move a
 stationary or fixed – they don’t move. Since they have to be upright, they have a large quantity of supportive tissue. The supportive tissue generally has dead cells. Animals on the other hand move around in sear ch of food, mates and shelter . They consume more energy as compared to plants. Most of the tissues they contain are living. Another difference between animals and plants is in the pattern of growth. The growth in plants is limited to certain regions, while this is not so in animals. There are some tissues in plants that divide throughout their life. These tissues are localised in certain regions. Based on the dividing capacity of the tissues, various plant tissues can be classified as growing or meristematic tissue and permanent tissue. Cell growth in animals is more uniform. So, there is no such demarcation of dividing and non- dividing regions in animals. The structural organisation of organs and organ systems is far more specialised and localised in complex animals than e
, there is no such demarcation of dividing and non- dividing regions in animals. The structural organisation of organs and organ systems is far more specialised and localised in complex animals than even in very complex plants. This fundamental difference reflects the different modes of life pursued by these two major groups of organisms, particularly in their different feeding methods. Also, they are differently adapted for a sedentary existence on one hand (plants) and active locomotion on the other (animals), contributing to this difference in organ system design. It is with reference to these complex animal and plant bodies that we will now talk about the concept of tissues in some detail.6 T TT TTISSUES ISSUESISSUES ISSUESISSUESChapter Reprint 2025-26  [Source: iesc106.pdf - Page 1] Lateral meristemuestions 1.What is a tissue? 2.What is the utility of tissues in multi-cellular organisms? 6.2Plant Tissues 6.2.1 MERISTEMATIC TISSUE•From the above observations, answer the following q

Why? 2.Do the roots continue growing even after we have removed their tips? 3.Why would the tips stop growing in jar 2 after we cut them? The growth of plants occurs only in certain specific regions. This is because the dividing tissue, also known as meristematic tissue, is located only at these points. Depending on the r egion where they are pr esent, meristematic tissues ar e classified as apical, lateral and inter calary (Fig. 6.2). New cells produced by meristem are initially like those of meristem itself, but as they grow and mature, their characteristics slowly change and they become differentiated as components of other tissues.

Parenchyma is the most common simple permanent tissue. It consists of relatively unspecialised cells with thin cell walls. They are living cells.

Often these walls are so thick that there is no internal space inside the cell (Fig. 6.4 c).

Most epidermal cells are relatively flat. Often their outer and side walls are thicker than the inner wall. We can observe small por es her e and there in the epidermis of the leaf. These pores are called stomata (Fig. 6.5). Stomata are enclosed by two kidney-shaped cells called guard cells. They are necessary for exchanging gases with the atmosphere. Transpiration (loss of water in the for m of water vapour) also takes place through stomata. Reprint 2025-26  [Source: iesc106.pdf - Page 4] SCIENCE 64Recall which gas is required for photosynthesis.

distinctive feature of the complex plants, one that has made possible their survival in the terrestrial environment. In Fig. 6.3 showing a section of stem, can you see different types of cells in the vascular bundle? Xylem consists of tracheids, vessels, xylem parenchyma (Fig. 6.7 a,b,c) and xylem fibres. Tracheids and vessels have thick walls, and many ar e dead cells when matur e. Tracheids and vessels are tubular structures. This allows them to transport water and minerals vertically. The parenchyma stores food. Xylem fibres are mainly supportive in function. Phloem is made up of five types of cells: sieve cells, sieve tubes, companion cells, phloem fibres and the phloem parenchyma [Fig. 6.7 (d)]. Sieve tubes are tubular cells with perforated walls. Phloem transports food from leaves to other parts of the plant. Except phloem fibres, other phloem cells are living cells. 6.2.2 ( ii) COMPLEX  PERMANENT  TISSUE The different types of tissues we have discussed until now are all made of

Such tissues ar e called simple per manent tissue. Y et another type of permanent tissue is complex tissue. Complex tissues are made of more than one type of cells. All these cells coordinate to perform a common function. Xylem and phloem are examples of such complex tissues. They are both conducting tissues and constitute a vascular bundle.

of mitochondria we studied earlier provide a clue to this question. Blood flows and carries various substances from one part of the body to the other . For example, it carries oxygen and food to all cells. It also collects wastes from all parts of the body and carries them to the liver and kidney for disposal. Blood and muscles are both examples of tissues found in our body. On the basis of  the functions they perform we can think of different types of animal tissues, such as epithelial tissue, connective tissue, muscular tissue and nervous tissue. Blood is a type of connective tissue, and muscle forms muscular tissue. 6.3.1 EPITHELIAL  TISSUE The covering or protective tissues in the animal body are epithelial tissues. Epithelium covers most organs and cavities within the body. It also forms a barrier to keep different body systems separate. The skin, the lining of the mouth, the lining of blood vessels, lung alveoli and kidney tubules are all made of epithelial tissue. Epithelial tis
rms a barrier to keep different body systems separate. The skin, the lining of the mouth, the lining of blood vessels, lung alveoli and kidney tubules are all made of epithelial tissue. Epithelial tissue cells are tightly packed and form a continuous sheet. They have only a small amount of cementing material between them and almost no intercellular spaces. Obviously, anything entering or leaving the body must cross at least one layer of epithelium. As a result, the permeability of the cells of various epithelia play an important role in regulating the exchange of materials between the body and the external environment and also between different parts of the body. Regardless of the type, all epithelium is usually separated from the underlying tissue by an extracellular fibrous basement membrane. Different epithelia (Fig. 6.9) show differing structures that correlate with their unique functions. For example, in cells lining blood vessels or lung alveoli, where transportation of substance

Simple squamous epithelial cells are extremely thin and flat and form a delicate lining. The oesophagus and the lining of the mouth are also covered with squamous epithelium. The skin, which protects the body, is also made of squamous epithelium. Skin epithelial cells are arranged in many layers to prevent wear and tear . Since they ar e arranged in a pattern of layers, the epithelium is called stratified squamous epithelium.

d squamous epithelium. Wher e absorption and secr etion occur , as in the inner lining of the intestine, tall epithelial cells are present. This columnar (meaning ‘pillar -like’) epithelium facilitates movement across the epithelial barrier . In the r espiratory tract, the columnar epithelial tissue also has cilia, which ar e hair -like pr ojections on the outer surfaces of epithelial cells. These cilia can move, and their movement pushes the mucus forward to clear it. This type of epithelium is thus ciliated columnar epithelium. Cuboidal epithelium (with cube-shaped cells) forms the lining of kidney tubules and ducts of salivary glands, where it provides mechanical support. Epithelial cells often acquire additional specialisation as gland cells, which can secrete substances at the epithelial surface. Sometimes a portion of the epithelial tissue folds inward, and a multicellular gland is formed. This is glandular epithelium. 6.3.2 CONNECTIVE   TISSUE Blood is a type of connective tissu
ial surface. Sometimes a portion of the epithelial tissue folds inward, and a multicellular gland is formed. This is glandular epithelium. 6.3.2 CONNECTIVE   TISSUE Blood is a type of connective tissue. Why would it be called ‘connective’ tissue? A clue is provided in the introduction of this chapter! Now, let us look at this type of tissue in some more detail. The cells of connective tissue are loosely spaced and embedded in an intercellular matrix (Fig. 6.10). The matrix may be jelly like, fluid, dense or rigid. The nature of matrix differs in concordance with the function of the particular connective tissue. Activity 6.4 Take a drop of blood on a slide and observe different cells present in it under a microscope.of epithelium.

The plasma contains proteins, salts and hormones. Blood flows and transports gases, digested food, hor mones and waste materials to different parts of the body. Bone is another example of a connective tissue. It forms the framework that supports the body. It also anchors the muscles and supports the main or gans of the body. It is a strong and nonflexible tissue (what would be the advantage of these pr operties for bone functions?). Bone cells ar e embedded in a hard matrix that is composed of calcium and phosphorus compounds. Two bones can be connected to each other by another type of connective tissue called the ligament. This tissue is very elastic. It has considerable str ength. Ligaments contain very l
horus compounds. Two bones can be connected to each other by another type of connective tissue called the ligament. This tissue is very elastic. It has considerable str ength. Ligaments contain very little matrix and connect bones with bones. Tendons connect muscles to bones and are another type of connective tissue. Tendons are fibrous tissue with great strength but limited flexibility. Another type of connective tissue, cartilage, has widely spaced cells. The solid matrix is composed of pr oteins and sugars. Cartilage smoothens bone surfaces at joints and is also present in the nose, ear , trachea and larynx. W e can fold the cartilage of the ears, but we cannot bend the bones in our arms. Think of how  the two tissues are different! Areolar connective tissue is found between the skin and muscles, ar ound blood vessels and nerves and in the bone marr ow. It fills the space inside the or gans, supports inter nal organs and helps in r epair of tissues. Wher e are fats stor ed in our bo

Wher e are fats stor ed in our body? Fat- storing adipose tissue is found below the skin and between inter nal or gans. The cells of this tissue ar e filled with fat globules. Storage of fats also lets it act as an insulator . 6.3.3 MUSCULAR  TISSUE Muscular tissue consists of elongated cells, also called muscle fibres. This tissue is responsible for movement in our body.Fig. 6.10:  Types of connective tissues: (a) types of blood cells, (b) compact bone, (c) hyaline cartilage, (d) areolar tissue, (e) adipose tissue (a)Different white blood corpusclesNeutrophil (polynuclear leucocyte)Basophil EosinophilNucleusCytoplasm Lymphocyte Monocyte Platelets Haversian canal (contains blood vessels and nerve fibr es) Canaliculus (contains slender process of bone cell or osteocyte)Hyaline matrixChondrocyte Red blood corpuscle(b)(c) Re

These muscles are also called skeletal muscles as they are mostly attached to bones and help in body movement. Under the microscope, these muscles show alternate light and dark bands or striations when stained appr opriately. As a r esult, they ar e also called striated muscles. The cells of this tissue ar e long, cylindrical, unbranched and multinucleate (having many nuclei).

Smooth muscles [Fig. 6.11(b)] or involuntary muscles contr ol such movements. They ar e also found in the iris of the eye, in ureters and in the bronchi of the lungs. The cells are long with pointed ends (spindle-shaped) and uninucleate (having a single nucleus). They are also called unstriated muscles – why would they be called that?

SCIENCE 140We know that all living or ganisms need food. Food supplies pr oteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins and minerals, all of which we r equir e for body development, gr owth and health. Both plants and animals ar e major sources of food for us. W e obtain most of this food from agricultur e and animal husbandry. We read in newspapers that ef forts ar e always being made to impr ove pr oduction from agricultur e and animal husbandry. Why is this necessary? Why we cannot make do with the curr ent levels of pr oduction? India is a very populous country. Our population is mor e than one billion people, and it is still gr owing. As food for this gr owing population, we will soon need mor e than a quarter of a billion tonnes of grain every year . This can be done by far ming on more land.

Therefore, it is necessary to incr ease our production ef ficiency for both cr ops and livestock. Efforts to meet the food demand by incr easing food pr oduction have led to some successes so far . We have had the gr een revolution, which contributed to incr eased food-grain pr oduction. W e have also had the white revolution, which has led to better and more efficient use as well as availability of milk. However , these r evolutions mean that our natural resources are getting used more intensively. As a result, there are more chances of causing damage to our natural resources to the point of destroying their balance completely. Therefore, it is important that we should increase food production without degrading our environment anddisturbing the balances maintaining it.

portant that we should increase food production without degrading our environment anddisturbing the balances maintaining it. Hence, there is a need for sustainable practices in agriculture and animal husbandry. Also, simply increasing grain production for storage in warehouses cannot solve the problem of malnutrition and hunger . People should have money to purchase food. Food security depends on both availability of food and access to it. The majority of our population depends on agriculture for their livelihood. Increasing the incomes of people working in agriculture is therefore necessary to combat the pr oblem of hunger . Scientific management practices should be undertaken to obtain high yields from farms. For sustained livelihood, one should undertake mixed farming, intercropping, and integrated farming practices, for example, combine agriculture with livestock/poultry/fisheries/ bee-keeping. The question thus becomes – how do we increase the yields of crops and livestock? 12.1Im

Pulses like gram ( chana ), pea (matar ), black gram ( urad), green gram ( moong ), pigeon pea ( arhar ), lentil ( masoor ), provide us with protein. And oil seeds including soyabean, ground nut, sesame, castor , mustar d, linseed and sunflower provide us with necessary fats (Fig. 12.1).

The second is the nurturing of the cr op plants. The third is the pr otection of the growing and harvested cr ops from loss. Thus, the major groups of activities for impr oving cr op yields can be classified as: •Crop variety improvement •Crop pr oduction impr ovement •Crop protection management. 12.1.1 CROP VARIETY  IMPROVEMENT This approach depends on finding a crop variety that can give a good yield. V arieties or strains of cr ops can be selected by breeding for various useful characteristics such as disease r esistance, r esponse to fertilisers, product quality and high yields.

This cr ossing may be intervarietal (between dif ferent varieties), interspecific (between two dif ferent species of the same genus) or inter generic (between different genera). Another way of impr oving the crop is by intr oducing a gene that would provide the desir ed characteristic. This results in genetically modified cr ops. For new varieties of crops to be accepted, it is necessary that the variety pr oduces high yields under dif ferent conditions that ar e found in dif ferent ar eas.

Some of the factors for which variety impr ovement is done ar e: •Higher yield: T o increase the productivity of the cr op per acr e. •Impr oved quality: Quality considerations of cr op pr oducts vary from cr op to cr op. Baking quality is important in wheat, pr otein quality in pulses, oil quality in oilseeds and preserving quality in fruits and vegetables. •Biotic and abiotic r esistance: Cr ops production can go down due to biotic (diseases, insects and nematodes) and abiotic (dr ought, salinity, water logging, heat, cold and fr ost) str esses under dif ferent situations. V arieties resistant to these str esses can impr ove crop production. •Change in maturity duration: The shorter the duration of the cr op from sowing to harvesting, the mor e economical is the variety.

uration: The shorter the duration of the cr op from sowing to harvesting, the mor e economical is the variety. Such short durations allow far mers to gr ow multiple r ounds of cr ops in a year . Short duration also r educes the cost of crop production. Unifor m maturity makes the harvesting pr ocess easy and r educes losses during harvesting. •Wider adaptability: Developing varieties for wider adaptability will help in stabilising the cr op pr oduction under dif ferent envir onmental conditions. One variety can then be grown under dif ferent climatic conditions in dif ferent ar eas. •Desirable agr onomic characteristics: Tallness and pr ofuse branching ar e desirable characters for fodder cr ops.

Different farmers thus have more or less land, money and access to information and technologies. In short, it is the money or financial conditions that allow farmers to take up different farming practices and agricultural technologies. There is a correlation between higher inputs and yields. Thus, the farmer’s purchasing capacity for inputs decides cropping system and production practices. Therefore, production practices can be at different levels. They include ‘no cost’ production, ‘low cost’ production and ‘high cost’ production practices. 12.1.2 ( i)  NUTRIENT  MANAGEMENT Just as we need food for development, growth and well-b

Nutrients are supplied to plants by air , water and soil. Ther e are several nutrients which are essential for plants. Air supplies carbon and oxygen, hydrogen comes from water , and soil supplies the other thirteen nutrients to plants. Amongst these, some are required in large quantities and are therefore called macro-nutrients. The other nutrients are used by plants in small quantities and are therefore called micro-nutrients (Table 12.1).Q Reprint 2025-26  [Source: iesc112.pdf - Page 3] IMPROVEMENT  IN FOOD RESOURCES 143 143143143143our environment from excessive use of fertilizers.

Based on the kind of biological material used, manure can be classified as: (i)Compost and vermi-compost: The process in which far m waste material like livestock excreta (cow dung, etc.), vegetable waste, animal r efuse, domestic waste, sewage waste, straw, eradicated weeds etc. is decomposed in pits is known as composting. The compost is rich in or ganic matter and nutrients. Compost is also pr epar ed by using earthwor ms to hasten the process of decomposition of plant and animal refuse. This is called vermi-compost.

Fertilizers supply nitr ogen, phosphorus and potassium. They ar e used to ensur e good vegetative gr owth (leaves, branches and flowers), giving rise to healthy plants. Fertilizers are a factor in the higher yields of high-cost far ming. Fertilizers should be applied car efully in terms of pr oper dose, time, and observing pr e- and post-application pr ecautions for their complete utilisation. For example, sometimes fertilizers get washed away due to excessive irrigation and ar e not fully absorbed by the plants. This excess fertilizer then leads to water pollution. Also, as we have seen in the previous class, continuous use of fertilizers in an area can destroy soil fertility because the organic matter in the soil is not replenished and micro-organisms in the soil are harmed by the fertilizers used.

To increase the yield, the soil can be enriched by supplying these nutrients in the form of manure and fertilizers. uestions 1.What ar e macr o-nutrients and why ar e they called macr o- nutrients? 2.How do plants get nutrients?

Under such conditions, several different kinds of irrigation systems are adopted to supply water to agricultural lands depending on the kinds of water resources available. These include wells, canals, rivers and tanks. •Wells:  There are two types of wells, namely dug wells and tube wells. In a dug well, water is collected fr om water bearing strata. Tube wells can tap water fr om the deeper strata. Fr om these wells, water is lifted by pumps for irrigation. •Canals:  This is usually an elaborate and extensive irrigation system.

W eeds take up nutrients and reduce the growth of the crop. Therefore, removal of weeds from cultivated fields during the early stages of crop growth is essential for a good harvest. Generally insect pests attack the plants in thre e ways: (i) they cut the ro ot, stem and leaf, (ii) they suck the cell sap from various parts of the plant, and (iii) they bore into stem and fruits.

Diseases in plants are caused by pathogens such as bacteria, fungi and  viruses. These pathogens can be present in and transmitted through the soil, water and air . Weeds, insects and diseases can be controlled by various methods. O ne of the most commonly used methods is the use of pesticides, which include herbicides, insecticides and fungicides. These chemicals are sprayed on crop plants or used for treating seeds and soil. H owever , excessive use of these chemicals creates problems, since they can be poisonous to many plant and animal species and cause environmental pollution.

Proper cleaning and shelter facilities for cows and buf faloes are requir ed for humane farming, for the health of the animals and for pr oduction of clean milk as well. Animals require regular brushing to remove dirt andloose hair . They should be sheltered under well-ventilated roofed sheds that protect them from rain, heat and cold. The floor of the cattle shed needs to be sloping so as to stay dry and to facilitate cleaning. The food r equir ements of dairy animals are of two types: (a) maintenance requir ement, which is the food r equir ed to support the animal to live a healthy life, and (b) milk pr oducing r equir ement, which is the type of food r equir ed during the lactation period.

Fish pr oduction includes the finned true fish as well as shellfish such as prawns and molluscs. Ther e are two ways of obtaining fish. One is fr om natural resour ces, which is called captur e fishing. The other way is by fish far ming, which is called cultur e fishery. The water sour ce of the fish can be either seawater or fr esh water , such as in rivers and ponds. Fishing can thus be done both by captur e and cultur e of fish in marine and freshwater ecosystems. 12.2.3 ( i) MARINE   FISHERIES India’s marine fishery resources include 7500

Brackish water resour ces, wher e seawater and fr esh water mix together , such as estuaries and lagoons are also important fish r eservoirs.

ish production fr om these resources is thr ough aquacultur e. Fish cultur e is sometimes done in combination with a rice cr op, so that fish ar e grown in the water in the paddy field. Mor e intensive fish far ming can be done in composite fish cultur e systems. Both local and imported fish species ar e used in such systems.In such a system, a combination of five or six fish species is used in a single fishpond. These species ar e selected so that they do not compete for food among them having different types of food habits. As a r esult, the food available in all the parts of the pond is used. As Catlas are sur face feeders, Rohus feed in the middle-zone of the pond, Mrigals and Common Carps ar e bottom feeders, and Grass Carps feed on the weeds, together these species (Fig. 12.6) can use all the food in the pond without competing with each other .

An Italian bee variety, A. mellifera, has also been brought in to increase yield of honey.This is the variety commonly used for commercial honey production. The Italian bees have high honey collection capacity. They sting somewhat less. They stay in a given beehive for long periods, and breed very well. For commercial honey production, bee farms or apiaries are established. The value or quality of honey depends upon the pasturage, or the flowers available to the bees for nectar and pollen collection. In addition to adequate quantity of pasturage, the kind of flowers available will deter mine the taste of the honey. uestions 1.What ar e the desirable characters of bee varieties suitable for honey production? 2.What is pasturage and how is it related to honey production?Q (a) (b) Fig. 12.7:  (a) Arrangement of beehive in an apiary (b) honey extractor Q Wh

SCIENCE 100We have lear nt about the motion of objects and force as the cause of motion. W e have lear nt that a force is needed to change the speed or the dir ection of motion of an object. W e always observe that an object dropped from a height falls towar ds the earth. W e know that all the planets go around the Sun. The moon goes around the earth. In all these cases, there must be some force acting on the objects, the planets and on the moon. Isaac Newton could grasp that the same force is responsible for all these. This force is called the gravitational force. In this chapter we shall learn about gravitation and the universal law of gravitation. W e shall discuss the motion of objects under the influence of gravitational force on the earth. W e shall study how the weight of a body varies fr om place to place. We shall also discuss the conditions for objects to float in liquids. 9.1Gravitation We know that the moon goes ar ound the earth. An object when thrown upwards, reaches a ce

An object when thrown upwards, reaches a certain height and then falls downwards. It is said that when Newton was sitting under a tree, an apple fell on him. The fall of the apple made Newton start thinking. He thought that: if the earth can attract an apple, can it not attract the moon? Is the force the same in both cases? He conjectured  that the same type of force is responsible in both the cases. He argued that at each point of its orbit, the moon falls towards the earth, instead of going off in a straight line. So, it must be attracted by the earth. But we do not really see the moon falling towards the earth.Let us try to understand the motion of the moon by recalling activity 7.11.

Hold the other end of the thread and whirl it round, as shown in Fig. 9.1. •Note the motion of the stone. •Release the thread. •Again, note the direction of motion of the stone. Fig. 9.1: A stone describing a circular path with a velocity of constant magnitude. Before the thread is released, the stone moves in a circular path with a certain speed and changes direction at every point. The change in direction involves change in velocity or acceleration. The force that causes this acceleration and keeps the body moving along the circular path is acting towards the centre. This force is called the centripetal (meaning ‘centre-seeking’) force.9 GGG GGRAVITATIONRAVITATIONRAVITATIONRAVITATIONRAVITATIONChapter Reprint 2025-26  [Source: iesc109.pdf - Page 1] GRAVITATION 1019.1.1 UNIVERSAL  LAW OF GRAVITATION Every object in the universe attracts every other o

It is seen that a falling apple is attracted towar ds the earth. Does the apple attract the earth? If so, we do not see the earth moving towar ds an apple. Why? According to the thir d law of motion, the apple does attract the earth. But accor ding to the second law of motion, for a given for ce, acceleration is inversely pr oportional to the mass of an object [Eq. (8.4)]. The mass of an apple is negligibly small compar ed to that of the earth. So, we do not see the earth moving towar ds the apple. Extend the same ar gument for why the earth does not move towar ds the moon. In our solar system, all the planets go around the Sun.

The r esistance offered by air to the paper is mor e than the resistance offered to the stone. If we do the experiment in a glass jar from which air has been sucked out, the paper and the stone would fall at the same rate.change in the velocity of falling objects? While falling, there is no change in the direction of motion of the objects. But due to the earth’s attraction, there will be a change in the magnitude of the velocity. Any change in velocity involves acceleration. Whenever an object falls towar ds the earth, an acceleration is involved. This acceleration is due to the earth’s gravitational for ce. Ther efore, this acceleration is called the acceleration due to the gravitational for ce of t
r ds the earth, an acceleration is involved. This acceleration is due to the earth’s gravitational for ce. Ther efore, this acceleration is called the acceleration due to the gravitational for ce of the earth (or acceleration due to gravity). It is denoted by g. The unit of g is the same as that of acceleration, that is, m s–2. We know fr om the second law of motion that for ce is the pr oduct of mass and acceleration. Let the mass of the stone in activity 9.2 be m. We already know that ther e is acceleration involved in falling objects due to the gravitational for ce and is denoted by g. Therefor e the magnitude of the gravitational force F will be equal to the pr oduct of mass and acceleration due to the gravitational force, that is, F = m g (9.6) From Eqs. (9.4) and (9.6) we have 2= G×M m m g d or G2M g = d(9.7) where M is the mass of the earth, and d is the distance between the object and the earth. Let an object be on or near the sur face of the earth. The distance d in Eq. (9.7) 
 m m g d or G2M g = d(9.7) where M is the mass of the earth, and d is the distance between the object and the earth. Let an object be on or near the sur face of the earth. The distance d in Eq. (9.7) will be equal to R , the radius of the earth. Thus, for objects on or near the sur face of the earth, G2M × m mg = R(9.8)   G2M g = R(9.9) The earth is not a perfect sphere. As the radius of the earth increases from the poles to the equator , the value of g becomes gr eater at the poles than at the equator . For most Reprint 2025-26  [Source: iesc109.pdf - Page 4] SCIENCE 104We know that an object experiences acceleration during free fall. From Eq. (9.9), this acceleration experienced by an object is independent of its mass. This means that all objects hollow or solid, big or small, should fall at the same rate. According to a story, Galileo dr opped dif ferent objects fr om the top of the Leaning T ower of Pisa in Italy to pr ove the same. As g is constant near the earth, all the equation

As g is constant near the earth, all the equations for the unifor mly accelerated motion of objects become valid with acceleration a replaced by g. The equations are: v = u + at (9.10) s = ut + 1 2 at2(9.11) v2 = u2 + 2as (9.12) where u and v are the initial and final velocities and s is the distance covered in    time, t. In applying these equations, we will take acceleration, a to be positive when it is in the direction of the velocity, that is, in the direction of motion.

We have also lear nt that gr eater the mass, the greater is the inertia. It remains the same whether the object is on the earth, the moon or even in outer space. Thus, the m
e measure of its inertia . We have also lear nt that gr eater the mass, the greater is the inertia. It remains the same whether the object is on the earth, the moon or even in outer space. Thus, the mass of an object is constant and does not change from place to place. 9.4Weight We know that the earth attracts every object with a certain force and this force depends on the mass ( m) of the object and the acceleration due to the gravity (g ). The weight of an object is the force with which it is attracted towards the earth. We know that F = m × a, (9.13) that is, F = m × g. (9.14) The force of attraction of the earth on an object is known as the weight of the object. It is denoted by W. Substituting the same in Eq. (9.14), we have W = m × g (9.15) As the weight of an object is the force with which it is attracted towards the earth, the SI unit of weight is the same as that of force, that is, newton (N). The weight is a force acting vertically downwards; it has both magnitude and directi
h which it is attracted towards the earth, the SI unit of weight is the same as that of force, that is, newton (N). The weight is a force acting vertically downwards; it has both magnitude and direction. We have lear nt that the value of g is constant at a given place. Therefore at a given place, the weight of an object is directly proportional to the mass, say m, of the object, that is, W ∝ m. It is due to this reason that at a given place, we can use the weight of an object as a measure of its mass. The mass of an object remains the same everywhere, that is, on the earth and on any planet whereas its weight depends on its location because g depends on location. 9.4.1 WEIGHT  OF AN OBJECT ON THE MOON We have lear nt that the weight of an object on the earth is the force with which the earthattracts the object. In the same way, the weight of an object on the moon is the force with which the moon attracts that object. The mass of the moon is less than that of the earth. Due to this the 
thattracts the object. In the same way, the weight of an object on the moon is the force with which the moon attracts that object. The mass of the moon is less than that of the earth. Due to this the moon exerts lesser force of attraction on objects. Let the mass of an object be m. Let its weight on the moon be Wm. Let the mass of the moon be Mm and its radius be  Rm. By applying the universal law of gravitation, the weight of the object on the moon will be 2G×=m m mM mW R(9.16) Let the weight of the same object on the earth be We.

Here the force is acting perpendicular to the surface of the sand. The force acting on an object perpendicular to the surface is called thrust. When you stand on loose sand, the for ce, that is, the weight of your body is acting on an ar ea equal to ar ea of your feet. When you lie down, the same for ce acts on an ar ea equal to the contact ar ea of your whole body, which is lar ger than the ar ea of your feet.

Find the pr essur e exertedby the wooden block on the table top if it is made to lie on the table top with its sides of dimensions (a) 20 cm  × 10 cm and (b) 40 cm × 20 cm. Solution: The mass of the wooden block = 5 kg The dimensions = 40 cm ×  20 cm ×  10 cm Here, the weight of the wooden block applies a thrust on the table top.

ck = 5 kg The dimensions = 40 cm ×  20 cm ×  10 cm Here, the weight of the wooden block applies a thrust on the table top. That is,   Thrust = F = m × g =5 kg × 9.8 m s–2 =49 N Area of a side = length × breadth =20 cm × 10 cm =200 cm2 = 0.02 m2 From Eq. (9.20), Pressur e = 249N 0.02m = 2450 N m-2. When the block lies on its side of dimensions 40 cm ×  20 cm, it exerts the same thrust. Area=length × breadth =40 cm × 20 cm =800 cm2 = 0.08 m2 From Eq. (9.20), Pressur e = 249 N 0.08 m =612.5 N m–2 The pr essur e exerted by the side 20 cm × 10 cm is 2450 N m–2 and by the side 40 cm × 20 cm is 612.5 N m–2. Thus, the same for ce acting on a smaller area exerts a larger pressure, and a smaller pressure on a larger area.

To keep the bottle completely immersed, the upwar d force on the bottle due to water must be balanced. This can be achieved by an exter nally applied for ce acting downwar ds. This for ce must at least be equal to the differ ence between the upwar d force and the weight of the bottle. The upwar d force exerted by the water on the bottle is known as upthrust or buoyant force. In fact, all objects experience a for ce of buoyancy when they ar e immersed in a fluid.

How can you immerse the bottle in water? The for ce due to the gravitational attraction of the earth acts on the bottle in the downwar d dir ection. So the bottle is pulled downwar ds.

You will find that the elongation of the string or the reading of the balance decreases as the stone is gradually lower ed in the water . However , no further change is observed once the stone gets fully immersed in the water . What do you infer from the decrease in the extension of the string or the reading of the spring balance? We know that the elongation pr oduced in the string or the spring balance is due to the weight of the stone. Since the extension decreases once the stone is lower ed in water , it means that some force acts on the stone in upward direction. As a result, the net force on the string de
the weight of the stone. Since the extension decreases once the stone is lower ed in water , it means that some force acts on the stone in upward direction. As a result, the net force on the string decreases and hence the elongation also decr eases. As discussed earlier , this upward force exerted by water is known as the force of buoyancy. What is the magnitude of the buoyant force experienced by a body? Is it the same in all fluids for a given body? Do all bodies in a given fluid experience the same buoyant force? The answer to these questions is contained in Archimedes’ principle, stated as follows:Activity ______________ 9.6 •Take a beaker filled with water . •Take a piece of cork and an ir on nail of equal mass. •Place them on the sur face of water . •Observe what happens. The cork floats while the nail sinks. This happens because of the dif ference in their densities. The density of a substance is defined as the mass per unit volume. The density of cork is less than the density o
oats while the nail sinks. This happens because of the dif ference in their densities. The density of a substance is defined as the mass per unit volume. The density of cork is less than the density of water . This means that the upthrust of water on the cork is gr eater than the weight of the cork. So it floats (Fig. 9.5). The density of an iron nail is more than the density of water . This means that the upthrust of water on the ir on nail is less than the weight of the nail. So it sinks. Therefore objects of density less than that of a liquid float on the liquid. The objects of density gr eater than that of a liquid sink in the liquid. uestions 1.Why is it dif ficult to hold a school bag having a strap made of a thin and str ong string? 2.What do you mean by buoyancy? 3.Why does an object float or sink when placed on the sur face of water? 9.6Archimedes’ Principle Activity ______________ 9.7 •Take a piece of stone and tie it to one end of a rubber string or a spring balance. •Suspen

Fig. 2.1:  Some consumable items Have you ever noticed the word ‘pure’ written on the packs of these consumables? For a common person pure means having no adulteration. But, for a scientist all these things are actually mixtures of different substances and hence not pure. For example, milk is actually a mixtur e of water , fat, pr oteins, etc. When a scientist says that something is pure, it means that all the constituent particles of that substance are the same in their chemical nature. A pure substance consists of a single type of particle. In other words, a substance is a pur e single for m of matter .

However , sodium chloride is itselfa pure substance and cannot be separated by physical process into its chemical constituents. Similarly, sugar is a substance which contains only one kind of pure matter and its composition is the same throughout. Soft drink and soil are not single pure substances. Whatever the source of a pure substance may be, it will always have the same characteristic properties. Therefore, we can say that a mixture contains more than one pure substance. 2.1.1 TYPES OF MIXTURES Depending upon the nature of the components that form a mixture, we can have different types of mixtures.

Such mixtures are called homogeneous mixtures or solutions. Some other examples of such mixtures are: (i) salt dissolved in water and (ii) sugar dissolved in water .

Though both the groups have obtained copper sulphate solution but the intensity of colour of the solutions is different. This shows that a homogeneous mixture can have a variable composition. •Groups C and D have obtained mixtures, which contain physically distinct parts and have non-uniform compositions. Such mixtures are called heterogeneous mixtures. Mixtures of sodium chloride and iron filings, salt and sulphur , and oil and water ar e examples of heterogeneous mixtures.

Group D has got a colloidal solution.Now, we shall learn about solutions, suspensions and colloidal solutions in the following sections. uestions 1.What is meant by a substance? 2.List the points of differences between homogeneous and heterogeneous mixtures. 2.2What is a Solution? A solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or mor e substances. Y ou come acr oss various types of solutions in your daily life. Lemonade, soda water , etc., ar e all examples of solutions. Usually we think of a solution as a liquid that contains either a solid, liquid or a gas dissolved in it. But, we can also have solid solutions (alloys) and gaseous solutions (air). In a solution there is homogeneity at the particle level. For example, lemonade tastes the same throughout. This shows that particles of sugar or salt are evenly di

This shows that particles of sugar or salt are evenly distributed in the solution.Q Fig. 2.2:  Filtration Alloys : Alloys are mixtures of two or more metals or ametal and  a non-metal and cannot be separated into their components by physical methods. But still, an alloy is considered as a mixture because it shows the properties of its constituents and can have variable composition. For example, brass is a mixture of approximately 30% zinc and 70% copper .

The component of the solution that dissolves the other component in it (usually the component present in larger amount) is called the solvent.

other component in it (usually the component present in larger amount) is called the solvent.  The component of the solution that is dissolved in the solvent (usually present in lesser quantity) is called the solute. Examples: (i)A solution of sugar in water is a  solid in liquid solution. In this solution, sugar is the solute and water is the solvent. (ii)A solution of iodine in alcohol known as ‘tincture of iodine’, has iodine (solid) as the solute and alcohol (liquid) as the solvent. (iii)Aerated drinks like soda water , etc., ar e gas in liquid solutions. These contain carbon dioxide (gas) as solute and water (liquid) as solvent. (iv)Air is a mixture of gas in gas. Air is a homogeneous mixture of a number of gases. Its two main constituents are: oxygen (21%) and nitrogen (78%). The other gases are present in very small quantities. Properties of a Solution •A solution is a homogeneous mixture. •The particles of a solution are smaller than 1 nm (10-9 metre) in diameter . So, they can
er gases are present in very small quantities. Properties of a Solution •A solution is a homogeneous mixture. •The particles of a solution are smaller than 1 nm (10-9 metre) in diameter . So, they cannot be seen by naked eyes. •Because of very small particle size, they do not scatter a beam of light passing through the solution. So, the path of light is not visible in a solution. •The solute particles cannot be separated from the mixture by the process of filtration. The solute particles do not settle down when left undisturbed , that is, a solution is stable. 2.2.1 C ONCENTRATION  OF A SOLUTION In activity 2.2, we observed that groups A and B obtained different shades of solutions. So, we understand that in a solution the relativeproportion of the solute and solvent can be varied. Depending upon the amount of solute present in a solution, it can be called  dilute, concentrated or  saturated solution. Dilute and concentrated are comparative terms. In activity 2.2, the solution obtained
ng upon the amount of solute present in a solution, it can be called  dilute, concentrated or  saturated solution. Dilute and concentrated are comparative terms. In activity 2.2, the solution obtained by group A is dilute as compared to that obtained by group B. Activity ______________ 2.3 •Take approximately 50 mL of water each in two separate beakers. •Add salt in one beaker and sugar or barium chloride in the second beaker with continuous stirring. •When no more solute can be dissolved, heat the contents of the beaker to raise the temperature by about 5oC.° •Start adding the solute again. Is the amount of salt and sugar or barium chloride, that can be dissolved in water  at a given temperature, the same? At any particular temperature, a solution that has dissolved as much solute as it is capable of dissolving, is said to be a saturated solution. In other words, when no more solute can be dissolved in a solution at a given temperature, it is called a saturated solution. The amount of
s capable of dissolving, is said to be a saturated solution. In other words, when no more solute can be dissolved in a solution at a given temperature, it is called a saturated solution. The amount of the solute present in the saturated solution at this temperature is called its solubility. If the amount of solute contained in a solution is less than the saturation level, it is called an unsaturated solution. What would happen if you were to take a saturated solution at a certain temperature and cool it slowly. We can infer fr om the above activity that different substances in a given solvent have different solubilities at the same temperature. The concentration of a solution is the amount (mass or volume) of solute present in a given amount (mass or volume) of solution . There are various ways of expressing the concentration of a solution, but here we will learn only three methods. (i)Mass by mass percentage of a solution Mass of solute= ×100 Mass of solution Reprint 2025-26  [Source:

Calculate the concentration in terms of mass by mass percentage of the solution. Solution: Mass of solute (salt) =40 g Mass of solvent (water) =320 g We know, Mass of solution = Mass of solute + Mass of solvent = 40 g + 320 g = 360 g Mass percentage of solution Mass of solute= ×100 Massof solution                  40= ×100 =11.1% 360 2.2.2 W HAT IS A SUSPENSION ?

              40= ×100 =11.1% 360 2.2.2 W HAT IS A SUSPENSION ? Non-homogeneous systems, like those obtained by group C in activity 2.2, in which solids are dispersed in liquids, are called suspensions. A suspension is a heterogeneous mixture in which the solute  particles do not dissolve but remain suspended throughout the bulk of the medium. Particles of a suspension are visible to the naked eye. Properties of a Suspension •Suspension is a heterogeneous mixture. •The particles of a suspension can be seen by the naked eye.•The particles of a suspension scatter a beam of light passing through it and make its path visible. •The solute particles settle down when a suspension is left undisturbed, that is, a suspension is unstable. They can be separated from the mixture by the process of filtration. When the particles settle down, the suspension breaks and it does not scatter light any more. 2.2.3 WHAT IS  A COLLOIDAL SOLUTION? The mixture obtained by group D in activity 2.2 is called a co
ation. When the particles settle down, the suspension breaks and it does not scatter light any more. 2.2.3 WHAT IS  A COLLOIDAL SOLUTION? The mixture obtained by group D in activity 2.2 is called a colloid or a colloidal solution. The particles of a colloid are uniformly spread throughout the solution. Due to the relatively smaller size of particles, as compared to that of a suspension, the mixture appears to be homogeneous. But actually, a colloidal solution is a heterogeneous mixture, for example, milk. Because of the small size of colloidal particles, we cannot see them with naked eyes. But, these particles can easily scatter a beam of visible light as observed in activity 2.2. This scattering of a beam of light is called the Tyndall effect after the name of the scientist who discovered this effect. Tyndall effect can also be observed when a fine beam of light enters a room through a small hole. This happens due to the scattering of light by the particles of dust and smoke in the ai
 this effect. Tyndall effect can also be observed when a fine beam of light enters a room through a small hole. This happens due to the scattering of light by the particles of dust and smoke in the air . Fig. 2.3: (a) Solution of copper sulphate does not show Tyndall effect, (b) mixture of water and milk shows Tyndall effect.(a) (b) Reprint 2025-26  [Source: iesc102.pdf - Page 4] SCIENCE 18 18181818Q•Colloids are big enough to scatter a beam of light passing through it and make its path visible. •They do not settle down when left undisturbed, that is, a colloid is quite stable. •They cannot be separated from the mixture by the process of filtration. But, a special technique of separation known as centrifugation can be used to separate the colloidal particles. The components of a colloidal solution are the dispersed phase and the dispersion medium. The solute-like component or the dispersed particles in a colloid form the dispersed phase, and the component in which the dispersed phase i
solution are the dispersed phase and the dispersion medium. The solute-like component or the dispersed particles in a colloid form the dispersed phase, and the component in which the dispersed phase is suspended is known as the dispersing medium. Colloids are classified according to the state (solid, liquid or gas) of the dispersing medium and  the dispersed phase. A few common examples are given in Table 2.1. From this table you can see that they are very common everyday life.Tyndall effect can be observed when sunlight passes through the canopy of a dense forest. In the forest, mist contains tiny droplets of water , which act as particles of colloid dispersed in air .

The properties that can be observed and specified like colour , har dness, rigidity, fluidity, density, melting point, boiling point etc. are the physical properites. The interconversion of states is a physical change because these changes occur without a change in composition and no change in the chemical nature of the substance.

conversion of states is a physical change because these changes occur without a change in composition and no change in the chemical nature of the substance. Although ice, water and water vapour all look different and display different physical properties, they are chemically the same. Both water and cooking oil  are liquid but their chemical characteristics are different. They dif fer in odour and inflammability. W e know that oil burns in air whereas water extinguishes fire. It is this chemical property of oil that makes it dif ferent fr om water . Burning is a chemical change. During this process one substance reacts with another to undergo a change in chemical composition. Chemical change brings change in the chemical properties of matter and we get new substances. A chemical change is also called a chemical reaction. During burning of a candle, both physical and chemical changes take place.

On the basis of their chemical composition, substances can be classified either as elements or compounds. 2.4.1 ELEMENTS Robert Boyle was the first scientist to use the term element in 1661. Antoine Laurent Lavoisier (1743–94), a French chemist, was the first to establish an experimentally useful definition of an element. He defined an element as a basic form of matter
rm element in 1661. Antoine Laurent Lavoisier (1743–94), a French chemist, was the first to establish an experimentally useful definition of an element. He defined an element as a basic form of matter that cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical reactions. Elements can be normally divided into metals, non-metals and metalloids. Metals usually show some or all of the following properties: •They have a lustre (shine). •They have silvery-grey or golden-yellow colour . •They conduct heat and electricity. •They are ductile (can be drawn into wires). •They are malleable (can be hammered into thin sheets). •They are sonorous (make a ringing sound when hit). Examples of metals ar e gold, silver , copper , iron, sodium, potassium etc. Mer cury is the only metal that is liquid at room temperature. Non-metals usually show some or all of the following properties: •They display a variety of colours. •They are poor conductors of heat and electricity. •They are not lustrous, sonorou
oom temperature. Non-metals usually show some or all of the following properties: •They display a variety of colours. •They are poor conductors of heat and electricity. •They are not lustrous, sonorous or malleable. Examples of non-metals are hydrogen, oxygen, iodine, carbon (coal, coke), bromine, Reprint 2025-26  [Source: iesc102.pdf - Page 6] SCIENCE 20chlorine etc. Some elements have intermediate properties between those of metals and non- metals, they are  called metalloids; examples are boron, silicon, germanium, etc. More to  know 2.4.2 COMPOUNDS A compound is a substance composed of two or more elements, chemically combined with one another in a fixed proportion.

The gas obtained by Group I is hydrogen, it is colourless, odourless and combustible– it is not advised to do the combustion test for hydrogen in the class. The gas obtained by Group II is hydrogen sulphide. It is a colourless gas with the smell of rotten eggs.
